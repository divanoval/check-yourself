First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside:
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.
Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.
Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.
Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.
Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.
Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.
Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084."""
