Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a whole bunch of nested 1 + 3 stuff. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ). That's a lot of parentheses! I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me write it down and see. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Wait, actually, looking back at the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (another expression)). So, actually, each layer is 3 times (1 + something). So maybe it's better to work from the inside <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that seems too big. Let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )). So each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So perhaps each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(something). Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a recursive sequence or something. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let's say a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has nine layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's a1 = 4, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous). So, if I have nine layers, then a9 would be the innermost part. Wait, but in the expression, it's 3*(a9). So the total expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have n layers, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n-1 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4, which would be a1. Then moving out, a2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Wait, hold on, I think I messed up earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to reconsider how I defined the sequence. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a1 as the innermost expression: a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer, it's 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So a2 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. So a3 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, a9 is 29524. But in the original expression, it's 3*(a9). Wait, is that right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression: <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) ). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, we have (1 + 3*4) = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 + 3*13) = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each time we move out a layer, we compute 1 + 3*(previous result). <nEwLiNe>So, after nine such operations, starting from 4, we get a9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, right? Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, is it 3*a9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me count the number of 3*(...) layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) ). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the outside, it's 3*(...). The inside of that is (1 + 3*(...)), which is another layer. So, each 3* is a separate layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect. Maybe the number of 3* layers is equal to the number of 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3*(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the outside: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>3. Inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers of 3*(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(...): starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then each 3 is inside another set of parentheses. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, after the first 3, each layer is 3(...). So, how many 3(...) are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I count the number of 3(, it's 9. Because starting from the first 3, then each 3( is another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it down: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, from the first 3, there are 8 more 3( inside. So, total of 9 layers of 3*(...). Therefore, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, my initial a1 was (1 + 3) = 4, then a2 = 3*(1 + a1) = 15, a3 = 3*(1 + a2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I was miscalculating before because I was starting with 1 + 3*a1, but perhaps it's 3*(1 + a1). Let's clarify. <nEwLiNe>Let me redefine the sequence properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say the innermost expression is E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, it's 3*(E9). So, the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so E9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought maybe it's 3*a9, but I was confused whether a9 was the innermost or not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to think about how many times we apply 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that contradicts my earlier definition. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the outside: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 3*( ... ) <nEwLiNe>Inside that: 1 + 3*( ... ) <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3*( ... ) <nEwLiNe>Inside that: 1 + 3*( ... ) <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 3*( ... ) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. So, is this the correct way? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my confusion arises from whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or (1 + 3*previous). Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's take a small example to clarify. Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute this. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Middle: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Outer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, with two layers of 3*(...), we get 48. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial approach, when I defined E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, which would be 1 + 12 = 13, which is different. <nEwLiNe>So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the small example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, middle layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Outer layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, the innermost is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from 4, we have two more layers, leading to 15 and then 48. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original problem, we have multiple layers. So, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in my initial calculation, I was defining E2 = 3*(1 + E1), which is correct. <nEwLiNe>So, E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3*(...) layers. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So, the first 3 is the outermost, then each inner 3 is a deeper layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many 3*(...) are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that: 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>3. Inside that: 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, there are 8 more 3( inside. So, total of 9 layers of 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, we have 8 more layers of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier small example, with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), there are two layers of 3*(...), resulting in E2 and E3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in that case, starting from E1 = 4, we have two layers: E2 = 15, E3 = 48. <nEwLiNe>So, if in the original problem, there are 9 layers of 3*(...), starting from E1 = 4, we need to compute up to E9. <nEwLiNe>But in my previous calculation, I went up to E9 = 36084, but that was only 8 layers after E1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>If E1 = innermost = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 is 36084. But the original expression is 3*(E9). Wait, no, in the original expression, E9 is the innermost, and then each layer is 3*(1 + E(n)). So, if we have 9 layers of 3*(...), starting from E1 = 4, then E9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I was miscounting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the small example, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) has two layers of 3*(...), resulting in E2 = 15 and E3 = 48. So, E3 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, in the original problem, with 9 layers of 3*(...), the outermost would be E9. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, it's written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). So, it's 3*(something), where something is 1 + 3*(...). So, in the small example, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(...), and inside that is 1 + 3*(...), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in terms of E(n), E1 is the innermost (1 + 3), and each subsequent E(n) is 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with 9 layers, E9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the small example, with 2 layers of 3*(...), we had E3 as the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is confusing. Let me think differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider the number of multiplications by 3. Each time we have a 3*(...), that's a multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, each layer adds another multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, if there are n layers of multiplication by 3, the total would be 3^n * (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that might not be the case. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote E(n) as the value of the expression with n layers of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>With E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>So, that's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write down the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>E(n) = 3 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relations. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is E(n) = 3*E(n-1). <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution E_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3A <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2A = 3 <nEwLiNe>A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>So, E(1) = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 12 + 3/2 = 27/2 <nEwLiNe>C = (27/2)/3 = 9/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>E(n) = (9*3^n)/2 - 3/2 = (9*3^n - 3)/2 = 3*(3*3^n - 1)/2 = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>(9*3^n - 3)/2 = 3*(3*3^n - 1)/2 = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 9 is 3^2, so 9*3^n = 3^{n+2}. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with small n. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: E(1) = (3^{3} - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct, as E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: E(2) = (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct, as E(2)=39. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: E(3) = (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct, as E(3)=120. <nEwLiNe>Great, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, in our original problem, how many layers do we have? <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3*(...): Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So, the first 3 is the outermost, and each inner 3 is another layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3*(...): <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so there are 9 layers of 3*(...). Therefore, n=9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(9) = (3^{9+2} - 3)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11 = 177147 <nEwLiNe>So, E(9) = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm once more. <nEwLiNe>If E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, and n=9, then E(9) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I compute step by step using the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>E(1) = 12 <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 3 + 3*12 = 3 + 36 = 39 <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 3 + 3*39 = 3 + 117 = 120 <nEwLiNe>E(4) = 3 + 3*120 = 3 + 360 = 363 <nEwLiNe>E(5) = 3 + 3*363 = 3 + 1089 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E(6) = 3 + 3*1092 = 3 + 3276 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E(7) = 3 + 3*3279 = 3 + 9837 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E(8) = 3 + 3*9840 = 3 + 29520 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E(9) = 3 + 3*29523 = 3 + 88569 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches the formula.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive or nested multiplication problem. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out. Each layer has a similar structure: 3 times (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost part, I can work my way outwards. That seems like a good strategy because if I start from the outside, I might get lost in the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Let me do it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, maybe I should compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that would mean the entire expression is 36,084? Hmm, let me verify that because that seems a bit big, but considering it's multiple layers, it might be correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems consistent. Each layer's result is used in the next layer's calculation. So, starting from 4, each time we multiply by 3 and add 3 more each time. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without going step by step. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 15 = 3*(3 + 1) = 9 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 48 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 16 is 15 + 1, so 3*(15 + 1) = 3*16. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3*(previous result + 1). So, it's a recursive relation where each term is 3*(previous term + 1). <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the nth term as a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(a_1 + 1) = 3*(4 + 1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(a_2 + 1) = 3*(15 + 1) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(a_3 + 1) = 3*(48 + 1) = 147 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 3*(a_{n-1} + 1) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Maybe we can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, because 3*(a_{n-1} + 1) = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The standard approach is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3) <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, now, for our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>11*6561: <nEwLiNe>Compute 10*6561 = 65,610 <nEwLiNe>Compute 1*6561 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171 <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, each a_n was 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which is the same as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is correct, and solving it gives us a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to double-check, let's compute a few layers manually and see if they match the formula. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, earlier we had a_4 = 147. Wait, that's not matching. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, hold on. There's a problem here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when n=4, according to my step-by-step, a_4 was 147, but according to the formula, a_4 is 444? That can't be. There must be an error. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on, no, in my step-by-step, I had: <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_4 should be 444? That doesn't align. So, I must have made a mistake in the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my indexing is wrong. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the step-by-step, the innermost expression was Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2 is n=2, which is 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is n=3, which is 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 is n=4, which is 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 is n=5, which is 444. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_1 = 4, a_2=15, a_3=48, a_4=147, a_5=444. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so when I computed a_4 in the formula, I must have miscalculated. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^{4-1} is 3^3=27. <nEwLiNe>So, a_4 = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_5 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Earlier, I must have miscalculated 3^{8} as 6561, but 3^8 is indeed 6561, as 3^7 is 2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 is 72,171, subtract 3 is 72,168, divide by 2 is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula works, and the step-by-step computation was correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute one more layer manually. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Using the formula, a_6 = (11*3^{5} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243. <nEwLiNe>11*243 = 2673. <nEwLiNe>2673 - 3 = 2670. <nEwLiNe>2670 / 2 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Using the formula, a_7 = (11*3^6 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729. <nEwLiNe>11*729 = 8019. <nEwLiNe>8019 - 3 = 8016. <nEwLiNe>8016 / 2 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Using the formula, a_8 = (11*3^7 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187. <nEwLiNe>11*2187 = let's compute: <nEwLiNe>10*2187 = 21,870 <nEwLiNe>1*2187 = 2,187 <nEwLiNe>Total: 21,870 + 2,187 = 24,057 <nEwLiNe>24,057 - 3 = 24,054 <nEwLiNe>24,054 / 2 = 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as a_9 from the formula. <nEwLiNe>So, everything checks out. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times something, and each time, it's multiplied by 3 again. Hmm, maybe I can figure out a pattern here. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression so I can see each layer clearly. It's like starting from the innermost part and working my way out. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? So let's start there. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. So: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, got it. So each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, and then add <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, wait, let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times that outermost result, right? Because it's 3*(...). So I think I forgot to multiply the final result by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply this by 3: 3*88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's different from my first thought. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is a new layer. Let's count the number of ""1 + 3(...)"" sections. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(...), each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is outside. <nEwLiNe>- Then each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of ""1 + 3"", and then the outermost 3*(...). Wait, no, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times we apply the operation. <nEwLiNe>Each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So starting from 1, we apply the operation 9 times, and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me try to parse the expression. <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's a 1 plus 3 times another expression, and this is nested 9 times, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, we can define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term, starting from 1, and doing this 9 times, then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let's define a recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>Let a_0 = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the result is 3*a_9 <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute a_1 through a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_0 = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought it was 265,719, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. Let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>If we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), then a_9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify with a smaller number of layers to see if the recurrence is correct. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>With 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>With 3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers, the result is 3*a_n where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>So, for 1 layer: 12 <nEwLiNe>2 layers: 39 <nEwLiNe>3 layers: 120 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the earlier computation, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_3 = 3*40 = 120, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute step by step, I got 88573 before multiplying by 3, which would give 265,719, but that must have been a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recast the computation: <nEwLiNe>Compute a_0 to a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_0 = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3*1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought of 88,573, but that was before multiplying by 3, which was a mistake. <nEwLiNe>So, to confirm: <nEwLiNe>Start with a_0 =1 <nEwLiNe>Then a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply a_9 by 3: 29524*3=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute a few more layers manually to ensure the pattern holds. <nEwLiNe>Wait, for example, with 4 layers: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost: 1+3=4 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 3: 3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>But according to the a_n sequence, a_4=121, so 3*a_4=363, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, with 5 layers: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>Compute: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1+3=4 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>Which matches 3*a_5=1092. <nEwLiNe>So, the pattern holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, confident that a_9=29,524, and 3*a_9=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that looks kind of complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up with a series of 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It seems like a recursive or nested structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. Wait, actually, it's 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), so each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that's too big. Let me do it properly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should define each level as a term. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Let me define each nested part as a term. Let me start from the innermost expression and move outward. So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one level out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, previous result was 4, so next level is 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next level out: 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*841 is 2523. So, 27000 + 2523 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*29524. Let me compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9524 is 28572. So, 60000 + 28572 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems like a big number. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 10 levels, right? Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside each 3(...) is another 1 + 3(...), and this repeats multiple times. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 1 + 3(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), and it seems there are 9 such layers inside the first 3(...). Let me count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers, because the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped in another 1 + 3(...), and finally the outermost is 3 multiplied by that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so maybe the total number of layers is 9? Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, inside the first 3, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3(...). Each time, the number of parentheses increases by one. <nEwLiNe>So, in my earlier calculation, I went through 10 steps, but maybe that's incorrect because the first step was just 1 + 3, then each subsequent step was adding another layer. So, perhaps the number of layers is 9, meaning I should have 9 steps of 1 + 3*(previous). Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>1. Start with innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers. So, the result after 9 layers is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, right? So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524. Let's see, 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72, carryover 7. <nEwLiNe>25 * 3 = 75 + 7 = 82, carryover 8. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15 + 8 = 23, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which led me to 88573, but then I realized that the number of layers is 9, so the last step was 3*29524, which is 88572. So, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>First, innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so 900 + 192 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523, so 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Tenth layer: Wait, hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by the ninth layer. So, we have nine layers inside the first 3(...), so we have to compute 3*(result after nine layers), which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the total computation is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step. Maybe it's a geometric series or something. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote the layers as a sequence, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, <nEwLiNe>and so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume a_p = K. Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solve for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the result. Therefore, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all the nested parentheses. Let me see how I can approach this. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems like a recursive structure, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let's define each layer as a separate step: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with the innermost part: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Continue this process, each time taking the result from the previous step and plugging it into the next layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let me start with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>**Step 1:** Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>1 + <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, got that. <nEwLiNe>**Step 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Step 1). So that's 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>**Step 2:** 1 + 3*(Step 1 result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so now that layer is 13. Next layer is 1 + 3*(Step 2 result). <nEwLiNe>**Step 3:** 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that's 40. Let's keep going. <nEwLiNe>**Step 4:** 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, that's getting big. Let me double-check that. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>**Step 5:** 1 + 3*121. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>**Step 5 result:** 364 <nEwLiNe>Moving on to the next layer. <nEwLiNe>**Step 6:** 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*364 first. Let's see, 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. <nEwLiNe>**Step 6 result:** 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>**Step 7:** 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270, plus 9 is 3279. Add 1: 3280. <nEwLiNe>**Step 7 result:** 3280 <nEwLiNe>Proceeding to the next step: <nEwLiNe>**Step 8:** 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Add 1: 9841. <nEwLiNe>**Step 8 result:** 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>**Step 9:** 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841. Let's break that down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29524. <nEwLiNe>**Step 9 result:** 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Step 9 result). <nEwLiNe>**Step 10:** 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now add them all up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Each step seems to follow correctly. I don't see any arithmetic errors in my calculations. So, yeah, I think the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure out a way to simplify this without getting lost in the layers. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with 3 multiplied by (1 + something). It seems like a repeating pattern, so maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 + 3 is 4. Hmm, okay, maybe I was overcomplicating it. Let's take it one step at a time. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then, the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. Continue this process until you reach the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me create a list or something to track each result as I go. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each step as S1, S2, S3, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost and S9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Compute S1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, S3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>S4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>S5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>S6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>S7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>S8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>S9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so after computing S9, which is 29524, is that the final result? Or is S9 just another step? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me re-examine the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). How many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. ... <nEwLiNe>Each additional layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count how many times 1 + 3 is nested. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 corresponds to a new layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, it's multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure: <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) has 8 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Wait, let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. Then another (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing, each (1 + 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a sum, which itself is 1 + 3 multiplied by another sum, and so on. Each time, you have a 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a new layer. Let me count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of layers is 8. Because starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let me check: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is 8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the expression, how many times does the pattern 1 + 3(...) occur? Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) segments. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that each time, the expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. <nEwLiNe>But, perhaps I can model this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, if I can figure out how many terms are in this sequence, I can compute the final result. <nEwLiNe>Given the original expression, let me see how many layers there are. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a term in the sequence, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first term. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent layer is another (1 + 3(...)). So, let's count the number of times (1 + 3 occurs. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: the expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me actually write out the expression with each layer labeled: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>But maybe it's getting too confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of multiplication operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better approach is to note that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute a_1 to a_9, since I see 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is a_2. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is 3*a_9, since the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))... So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result of the inner expression. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my previous computation, a_9 was 29524, which was 1 + 3*a_8. But actually, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). So, actually, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier steps, I was computing a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, ..., up to a_9 = 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>Total expression = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>So, each inner expression is of the form 1 + 3*(next inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost inner expression is 1 + 3*a_8 = a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the total expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check my multiplication again to be sure: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So yes, 88572. So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a_9. <nEwLiNe>Let me go through the a_n steps again: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to double-check, maybe I can compute a different way or see if there's a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps recognizing this as a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it explicitly. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. <nEwLiNe>Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>When n = 1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the explicit formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches the earlier computation. So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation explicitly, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Hmm, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). It seems like each time, we're adding a new layer by nesting another 1 + 3(...). Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think this might form a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. So it's 1 + <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I should compute each layer step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous total). So starting from 4, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, actually, this is a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with n=1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. n=2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. n=3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. n=4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. n=5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. n=6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. n=7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. n=8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. n=9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3 * 29524: Let's compute 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000. <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000. <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500. <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60. <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Now, adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500. <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560. <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can approach this problem differently, perhaps recognizing it as a geometric series or using a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). If we denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and each subsequent a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n + D, <nEwLiNe>where C and D are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>C*3^{n+1} + D = 3*(C*3^n + D) + 1. <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: <nEwLiNe>3*C*3^n + 3*D + 1 = C*3^{n+1} + 3D + 1. <nEwLiNe>So, LHS is C*3^{n+1} + D, RHS is C*3^{n+1} + 3D + 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, equate both sides: <nEwLiNe>C*3^{n+1} + D = C*3^{n+1} + 3D + 1. <nEwLiNe>Subtract C*3^{n+1} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>D = 3D + 1. <nEwLiNe>So, -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10} = 59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. Which matches the result we got earlier. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, we get the same result: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make absolutely sure, let me compute a few layers using the formula to see if it aligns with our step-by-step calculation. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I've checked it step by step, then used a formula approach to confirm. Both lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 88572 is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That looks like a lot of nested parentheses. Hmm, okay, so maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me write it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, let me count how many sets of parentheses there are. Starting from the innermost, it seems like there are nine sets of (1 + 3). So, maybe I should start with the innermost one and compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write out the expression again, but numbered from the inside out: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(result from step 1) + 1 <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 3*(result from step 2) + 1 <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should start from the <<INJECTED THINKING>> But wait, let me think through it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Compute (1 + 3). That's easy, 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Now, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3*(result from step 1)). So, that's 1 + 3*4. Let me compute 3*4 first, which is 12, then add 1: 12 + 1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Next layer out is (1 + 3*(result from step 2)). So, 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 3)). So, 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. 3*40 is 120, and 120 + 1 is 121. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 4)). So, 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 5)). So, 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Step 7: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 6)). So, 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Step 8: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 7)). So, 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Step 9: Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from step 8)). So, 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. So, after step 9, which gives 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, step 10: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's break it down. 3*20000 = 60000, 3*9000 = 27000, 3*500 = 1500, 3*24 = 72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my steps because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step is correct. So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4, let's see: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B <nEwLiNe>Assuming that for n=0, the expression would be a_0 = 1, because if we go one step beyond the innermost, it's just 1. So, a_0 = 1 = A*3^0 + B = A + B <nEwLiNe>So, we have two equations: <nEwLiNe>1. 3A + B = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. A + B = 1 <nEwLiNe>Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1: <nEwLiNe>2A = 3 => A = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Then, from equation 2: 3/2 + B = 1 => B = 1 - 3/2 = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Since we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 to a_9. Wait, actually, the innermost is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1, so the outermost layer is a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>So, either way, whether computing step by step or using the formula, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps another way: each time we have a 1 + 3(...), so the number of such expressions is equal to the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, after the initial 3(, there are eight more layers of 1 + 3(...). So total layers would be nine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from the innermost, layer 1 is 1 + 3, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), up to layer9, which is the outermost. Then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So my previous computation seems correct, with layer9 = 29524, and total result 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider that each layer is defined by a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote L_n as the value of the nth layer, where n is the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for L_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: <nEwLiNe>L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, L_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>L_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. So for n=9 layers: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches what I got earlier. So, the outermost expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 +12=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in multiplying 29524 by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3 step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(L_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11=59049*3=177147 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^{11}=177147 <nEwLiNe>Then, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144 / 2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, using both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a lot of parentheses! Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I think the best way is to start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That seems logical because each part is inside another, so solving the innermost first should make it easier. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies the innermost expression to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, calculate 3 times 4, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now that part simplifies to 13. Moving out another level <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, wait. Let me take it step by step.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I don't get confused. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost part is 3*(Level9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. 29524 * 3.  <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3:  <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me see if there's another way to approach this. Maybe recognizing a pattern or a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a series of nested 1 + 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous expression. So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. <nEwLiNe>If I denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, let's solve the homogeneous part: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, for n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our problem, the innermost expression is at level 1: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next level is a_2, and so on, up to level 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in our original problem, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then each subsequent level adds another 1 + 3*(...), so for 9 layers, we have a_9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation earlier. Therefore, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each level is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and we have 9 levels, starting from a_1=4, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, and 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that. If a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} -1)/2 = (3^{n+2} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, 3*a_9 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's another way to get the same result. So, either way, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's think about the expression as a repeated multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 1 + 3*(something). So, each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result every time. So, I think that's solid. It's a bit tedious, but step-by-step evaluation confirms the result. <nEwLiNe>Just to check, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) in a different way. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, that's 3*(a_9), where a_9 is as computed. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I expand the expression, it's like 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + 3^10, but no, actually, that's not quite accurate because each term is multiplied by 3 each time, but the structure is a bit different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, if I think of each layer as 1 + 3*previous, it's a bit like a geometric series but with a multiplier inside. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, if I expand a_n, it would be 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that true? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute a few terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, so a_n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n of 3^k? Wait, no, because: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + 3^1 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 1 + 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Which is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3^0 up to 3^n. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Which is exactly the formula we derived earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to think about it, using the sum of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I've verified it multiple ways now, so I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a long chain of 1s and 3s multiplied together. I need to figure out how to approach this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression to visualize it better. So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer would be 1 + 3 times that result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So it's recursive in a way. Each time, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer is built upon the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me define it step by step. Let's call each inner expression as a term. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the innermost part as A <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on. Let me not jump to conclusions. Let's actually compute each step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>First, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm keeping track correctly. Each time, I have a new layer that is 1 + 3*(previous total). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count how many parentheses there are. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3*(4)) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3*(13)) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3*(40)) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3*(121)) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3*(364)) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3*(1093)) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3*(3280)) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3*(9841)) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers inside, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from 4. So, 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify the count again. Each time I open a new parenthesis, that's a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>There are 9 opening parentheses: each 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, that would mean 9 layers, right? So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer1), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, that means I have 9 layers inside, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>---------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7 <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. It's easy to miscalculate when dealing with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4, that's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: <nEwLiNe>3*300 = 900 <nEwLiNe>3*60 = 180 <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, 900 + 180 = 1080 + 12 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 1092 = 1093, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: <nEwLiNe>3*1000 = 3000 <nEwLiNe>3*90 = 270 <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: <nEwLiNe>3*3000 = 9000 <nEwLiNe>3*200 = 600 <nEwLiNe>3*80 = 240 <nEwLiNe>So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*800 = 2400 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>3*1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>1 + 29523 = 29524, correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, these nested expressions can be represented by a formula, especially if they form a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from n=1 as the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, LHS: A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Set equal: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B: <nEwLiNe>-B = 1 <nEwLiNe>So, B = -1 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 5 => A = 5/3 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (5/3)*3^n -1 = 5*3^{n-1} -1 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = 5*3^{n-1} -1 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: 5*3^{0} -1 = 5 -1 =4, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: 5*3^{1} -1 =15 -1=14? Wait, but a_2 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in solving the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's double-check. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Plug into recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Thus, A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n: B = 1 + 3B => -2B=1 => B= -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, earlier I thought B=-1, but now I get B= -1/2. Hmm, maybe my initial substitution was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me do it again. <nEwLiNe>Assume a_n = A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, LHS: A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>RHS: 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B =1 => B= -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Ah, so B is -1/2, not -1. <nEwLiNe>Then, using initial condition a_1 =4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A -1/2 =4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me check for n=1: <nEwLiNe>(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>(81 -1)/2=80/2=40, correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, general term is a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for layer9, which is n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, then the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}=177147 <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the answer. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I double-checked each step, used a recurrence relation to find a formula, and verified that it gives the same result as step-by-step computation. So, confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. Let me write it down to see it more clearly. <nEwLiNe>It's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))). <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested 1s and 3s. It looks like a series of operations where each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, repeated several times. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>3. And this seems to go on until there are nine such operations. Wait, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(next step). Hmm, so maybe I should work from the inside <<INJECTED THINKING>> Let me think about how to compute this. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost part. Maybe I can write each step as a variable or compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, etc., up to E9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Each E is 1 + 3 times the next E. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until E9, and then the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of E's. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a step. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. E1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. E2 = 1 + 3*E1 <nEwLiNe>3. E3 = 1 + 3*E2 <nEwLiNe>4. E4 = 1 + 3*E3 <nEwLiNe>5. E5 = 1 + 3*E4 <nEwLiNe>6. E6 = 1 + 3*E5 <nEwLiNe>7. E7 = 1 + 3*E6 <nEwLiNe>8. E8 = 1 + 3*E7 <nEwLiNe>9. E9 = 1 + 3*E8 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, I need to compute E1 through E9 and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each step: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. Let me compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. Maybe it's a recurrence relation. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, starting with E1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply the initial condition E1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches what I got earlier. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a whole bunch of nested parentheses. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of 3s and 1s. Let me see how I can tackle this. <nEwLiNe>First off, I notice that it's a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like each level is 1 + 3*(next level). Since it's nested multiple times, maybe I can compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That seems manageable. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so let me count them. Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <<INJECTED THINKING>> I think. Hmm, wait, no, that's too many. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. Continuing this way, until we have 9 layers? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the main expression. <nEwLiNe>The main expression is 3(...). Inside that, there's 1 + 3(...). Each of those 3(...) has another 1 + 3(...). So how many 3(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the main 3, inside that, there's one 3(...), which inside that, another 3(...), and so on until how many? Let's see: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many 3(...) layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of closing parentheses. Starting from the end: the innermost is 1 + 3), then each layer adds another ). So the total number of closing parentheses is 9. Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3(...), which is 3 multiplied by a sum that has 9 layers of 3(...). So there are 9 layers of 3(...) inside the main expression. <nEwLiNe>So to compute this, I can start from the innermost layer and compute each step, moving outward. Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is the result of each nested expression.

Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's breaking down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. <nEwLiNe>So 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now add them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to compute this? Maybe by recognizing a pattern or formula? <nEwLiNe>Each a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_i. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches the previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result, 88572. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. By recognizing the pattern as a linear recurrence, I was able to find a formula to compute the innermost layers efficiently without having to manually compute each step, though in this case, since there were only 9 layers, computing step by step was manageable. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if the expression had more layers, the closed-form formula would be more efficient. But for this problem, both methods worked well. <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s with each layer having another 3 multiplied. Hmm, okay, maybe I can tackle this step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down again to visualize: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses:  <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that, the next layer out is 3(1 + 3(...)). Wait, actually, let me clarify how many layers there are <<INJECTED THINKING>> But wait, I shouldn't just say that. I need to work through it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count how many times 1 + 3 appears. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3 multiplied by 3. So let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but wait, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(...). So perhaps it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's a recursive computation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to compute each layer step by step. Let me label the layers from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define each expression starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is the final answer 88572? Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that seems consistent. Let me just recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of 1 + 3 expressions: <nEwLiNe>Each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer, starting from the innermost. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers because each time we have a 1 + 3(...), and there are 9 such expressions before the outermost 3(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting the parentheses: each time we have a pair of parentheses, so the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 + 3 multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So each layer is built on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, with 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems to add up. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is following the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, recognizing that this is a geometric series or something similar, but in this case, it's a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see if I can model this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>A particular solution would be a constant, say a_n^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*A = 1 <nEwLiNe>A = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to verify it. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with these kinds of expressions.  <nEwLiNe>Okay, so let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, each time, there's a 1 plus 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It looks like a recursive pattern or maybe a geometric series? I'm not entirely sure, but let's try expanding it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me start from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my work. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that was the final answer. Let me recast my thought process. <nEwLiNe>Starting over, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). So, 1 + 3 is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one level out, we have (1 + 3*(previous result)). So, that would be (1 + 3*4). Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*(13)). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each time, we take the result from the inner expression, multiply by 3, add 1, and then use that in the next level. <nEwLiNe>So, let's list these steps: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count how many levels there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Yes, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside another set of parentheses, so that's 9 levels. So, we have 9 steps of computation. <nEwLiNe>But when I listed the steps, I went up to 29524, which was step 9. So, that's the result of the innermost 9th step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, each level is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, after computing the innermost, we have 4, then 13, 40, etc., each time multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>But then, after computing that 9th step, which gives 29524, we need to multiply that by 3, right? Because the entire expression is 3 times that big parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... ))) <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(... )). So, after computing the innermost parentheses, we work our way out, each time computing 1 + 3*(result), until we get to the outermost parentheses, and then multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: (1 + 3*40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: (1 + 3*364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, so 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm. The original expression is 3*(...). So, once we compute the innermost parentheses, each time moving outward, computing 1 + 3*(result), and after 9 such computations, the result is 29524. Then, we have to multiply this by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. Let me do that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, 29524 * 3 is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, we computed each layer step by step, getting 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each step: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems correct. So, 29524 is the result inside the parentheses. Then, 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this pattern as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, the sequence is defined recursively by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me plug in the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, set equal: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 <nEwLiNe>Thus, B = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, since we have 9 layers, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the step-by-step computation! So, that's a good check. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value inside the parentheses is indeed 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*a_9, where a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let me see if I can write the entire expression as a sum. <nEwLiNe>Each term is 3^k, starting from k=1 to k=10, but with some coefficients. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... ))) which is similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>If we have a_1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 9 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each a_n adds another term of 3^n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, n=9, so a_9 = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^9. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the formula we had earlier was a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses is the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k, multiplied by 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*(sum)/2 = (3/2)*(sum). <nEwLiNe>But the sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k is (3^{10} - 1)/2, so multiplying by 3/2 gives (3/2)*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3^{11} is 177147. <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 - 3)/4 = 177144/4 = 44286. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's not matching the previous result of 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a problem. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, n=9, so 3*a_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Ah, okay, so I think I messed up the earlier step when I thought of it as (3/2)*(sum). Instead, it's 3*a_9, which is 3*(sum from k=0 to k=9 of 3^k)/2, which is indeed equal to (3^{11} - 3)/2, which is 88572. So, that aligns with the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that solidifies the conclusion. So, despite the intimidating number of parentheses, breaking it down step by step or recognizing the pattern as a geometric series both lead to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap: <nEwLiNe>- The expression is a nested multiplication of 3s and additions of 1s. <nEwLiNe>- Each layer can be computed by starting from the inside and working outward. <nEwLiNe>- Recognizing the pattern as a geometric series allows for a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>- Both methods confirm that the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this math problem here: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built using a series of nested 3(1 + ... ) terms. It looks like a recursive structure where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually helps with these kinds of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting Point: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. Wait, 1 + 3 is 4. Hmm, okay, so the innermost is 4. Then, moving one level out, we have 3 multiplied by that result, and then add 1. Let me structure this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each level as follows: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I need to clarify. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). So starting from Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Level 10: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, so the outermost multiplication is by 3, right? The original expression is 3*(...). So the total expression is 3*(Level 10). So if Level 10 is 88573, then the entire expression is 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>First, 80000*3 = 240000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 8000*3=24000, so 240000 + 24000 = 264000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 500*3=1500, so 264000 + 1500 = 265500 <nEwLiNe>Then, 70*3=210, so 265500 + 210 = 265710 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*3=9, so 265710 + 9 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 88573*3 is: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 88573 * 3: <nEwLiNe>3*3=9, write down 9. <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 + 2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2. But since there are no more digits, we write down 26. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that gives 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 88573*3: let me do it step by step. <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 + 2 =17, write 7, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +2=26, write 6, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But since there are no more digits, we just add the carryover: 26. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would make the number 265719. Wait, but 88573*3 is 265,719? Let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>Compute 88573 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>80,000 * 3 = 240,000 <nEwLiNe>8,000 * 3 = 24,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>70 * 3 = 210 <nEwLiNe>3 * 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>Now add them all up: <nEwLiNe>240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000 <nEwLiNe>264,000 + 1,500 = 265,500 <nEwLiNe>265,500 + 210 = 265,710 <nEwLiNe>265,710 + 9 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Level 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from Level 1 to Level 10: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>Level3:1+3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Level4:1+3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Level5:1+3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Level6:1+3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Level7:1+3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>Level8:1+3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>Level9:1+3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Level10:1+3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So Level 10 is 88573, then multiplying by 3 gives 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(Level10). So yes, 3*88573 is indeed 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, but just to be thorough, let me compute each level step by step. <nEwLiNe>Level1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level2: 1 + 3*4 =1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Level3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Level4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Level5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Level6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Level7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Level8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Level9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Level10:1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573 <nEwLiNe>So, each step is correct. Then, 3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me compute 3*88573 another way to double-check. <nEwLiNe>88573 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Start from the units digit: <nEwLiNe>3*3=9 <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +2=26, write down 6, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>Since there are no more digits, write down the carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 2 6 5 7 1 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 265,719. Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute the entire expression step by step, writing each level clearly. <nEwLiNe>Compute starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Start: <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(....). It seems like there are 9 levels of 1 + 3(...). Wait, let me count. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Level2: 1 + 3*(Level1) <nEwLiNe>Level3: 1 + 3*(Level2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many levels? Let's see, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds a level, so starting from the innermost, it's 9 levels. <nEwLiNe>Wait, innermost is (1 + 3), which is Level1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous level). So, the total number of levels is 9, meaning Level1 to Level9. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I had Level1 to Level10, but now I'm thinking maybe it's 9 levels. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each 1 + 3(...) is a level. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) =1 + 12=13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13)=40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40)=121 <nEwLiNe>5.1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6.1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7.1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8.1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9.1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>10.1 + 3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I count each 1 + 3(...) as a level, starting from the innermost, it's 9 layers, meaning Level1 to Level9. <nEwLiNe>But then, the entire expression is 3*(Level9). So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought Level10 was 88573, but maybe that's not correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, counting the number of 1 + 3(...) inside: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is one level. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 level. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each subsequent 1 + 3(...) adds another level. <nEwLiNe>So, let's count how many 1 + 3(...) there are: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time we move out, it's another level. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, then each 1 + 3( is a new level. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 1 + 3( is 9.

It's actually 9 levels, so Level9 is 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>But now, I'm getting conflicting results. Earlier, I thought the expression was 3*(Level10)=265,719, but now, with correct counting, it's 3*(Level9)=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check the structure. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" corresponds to a level. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1.

So, why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3( in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, then inside, it's 1 + 3(, which is another level. Then inside that, another 1 + 3(, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, how many 1 + 3( are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Then inside: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from the first 3(, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3(...). So, does that mean 9 levels inside? Or is the first 3( not counted as a level? <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the confusion arises from whether the initial 3( is considered a level or not. In my previous calculation, I considered each 1 + 3(...) as a level, starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Level1. Then, each subsequent layer is another level, so total levels equal to the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, how many 1 + 3(...) are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, the number increases. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to write out the structure: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3) =4 <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving out: 1 + 3*(4)=13 <nEwLiNe>- Then: 1 + 3*(13)=40 <nEwLiNe>- Then: 1 + 3*(40)=121 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(121)=364 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(364)=1093 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(1093)=3280 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(3280)=9841 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(9841)=29524 <nEwLiNe>- Then:1 + 3*(29524)=88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from the innermost, we have 9 levels, each time moving out. So, Level1 is (1 + 3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Level2:1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Level3:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Level4:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Level5:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Level6:1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Level7:1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>Level8:1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>Level9:1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Level10:1 + 3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>But then, the entire expression is 3*(Level10)=3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I counted the number of 1 + 3(...) in the original expression, I saw 9 instances. So, is Level10 the outermost one? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 9 levels of 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Level1, and the outermost is 1 + 3*(Level9)=Level10, and then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, in total, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3)=4, which is Level1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous level), so: <nEwLiNe>Level2:1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Level3:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Level4:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Level5:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Level6:1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Level7:1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>Level8:1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>Level9:1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Level10:1 + 3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*Level10=3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so earlier when I thought it was 88,572, I was mistaken because I miscounted the levels. The key is that the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), which results in Level10 being 88,573, and then multiplying by 3 gives 265,719. <nEwLiNe>To confirm, let me write out each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next:1 + 3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, it's similar to a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1=1 + 3=4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1=4 <nEwLiNe>a_2=1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>a_3=1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>a_4=1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>a_5=1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>a_6=1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7=1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8=1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9=1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>a_{10}=1 + 3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the total expression is 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Just to be thorough, let me check the arithmetic at each step: <nEwLiNe>a1=1+3=4 <nEwLiNe>a2=1 +3*4=1+12=13 <nEwLiNe>a3=1 +3*13=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>a4=1 +3*40=1+120=121 <nEwLiNe>a5=1 +3*121=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>a6=1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>a7=1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>a8=1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>a9=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>a10=1 +3*29524=1 +88572=88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a10=3*88573=265,719. <nEwLiNe>All these steps check out. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{265719} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. It looks like a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something.

Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First off, it looks like a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Since there are multiple layers, I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer one at a time without getting confused. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is \(1 + 3\). That's straightforward: \(1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that's not right. Let me actually compute it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost expression: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3(4)\). Let me compute that: \(3 \times 4 = 12\), so \(1 + 12 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3(13)\). So, \(3 \times 13 = 39\), then \(1 + 39 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3(40)\). \(3 \times 40 = 120\), so \(1 + 120 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3(121)\). \(3 \times 121 = 363\), so \(1 + 363 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3(364)\). \(3 \times 364 = 1092\), so \(1 + 1092 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3(1093)\). \(3 \times 1093 = 3279\), so \(1 + 3279 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3(3280)\). \(3 \times 3280 = 9840\), so \(1 + 9840 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3(9841)\). \(3 \times 9841 = 29523\), so \(1 + 29523 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: \(3 \times 29524\). Let me compute that: \(3 \times 29524 = 88572\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on a second. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. It's easy to slip up with larger numbers. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1 + 3 = 4\) – that's correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\) – correct. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: \(3 \times 29524\). Let me compute this again. 29524 times 3: 29524 x 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>- 20000 x 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000 x 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 x 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 x 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4 x 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right. So, 3 times 29524 is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate the number of layers. The original expression has multiple layers, each one adding another set of parentheses. Let me count them. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) – that's the innermost, layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, (1 + 3(layer1)) – layer 2 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(layer2)) – layer3 <nEwLiNe>4. ... and so on, until we reach the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time it's multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Each layer is one more set of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers. Wait, so each time I computed 9 layers? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when I started, I had: <nEwLiNe>1.

Then, 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers inside, each one adding another 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check again: when I count the number of layers, each time it's a new (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer1, then each additional (1 + 3(...)) is a new layer. So, in the original expression, how many such layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears: <nEwLiNe>- Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>- Then, each step outwards, it's (1 + 3(...)), so: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3( ... )) – that's the next one <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3( ... )) – another <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" introduces a new opening parenthesis. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>So, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>1.

Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The initial expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first ""1 + 3("", each subsequent layer adds another ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>So, let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2.

Then inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. Then inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. Then inside that: 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 9 times ""1 + 3("" after the initial 3(. <nEwLiNe>So, that means there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed earlier, I had 9 layers and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me see: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer1, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...), so layer2, layer3, up to layer9, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed the layers, I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps my initial computation is correct, leading to 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me write down each step again: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step is correct, and the multiplication by 3 at the end gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try computing it from the inside using a different approach, perhaps recognizing a pattern or using a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. <nEwLiNe>So, if we let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, starting from the innermost, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for such a recurrence. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same answer. So, I'm confident that the result is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>I don't think I made any mistakes in my calculations. Each step follows logically, and the recurrence relation approach confirms the result. So, I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Yes, so L8=9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, L9=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, notice that each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>Find A and B. <nEwLiNe>Using the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Assume solution L_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>Plug into the equation: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, equate LHS and RHS: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Then, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. I double-checked using both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, and both gave the same result. So, I'm confident the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is a nested series that can be evaluated by expanding each layer step by step. Starting from the innermost layer, each subsequent layer is computed by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each layer until the outermost expression is reached. The final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"
