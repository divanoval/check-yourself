Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a recursive or nested expression where each level is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out. So, starting from the innermost part and working my way outward. That makes sense because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it.  <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the innermost part first: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one level out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me assign each level a number to keep track. Let's say level 1 is the innermost, and level 9 is the outermost since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. I think I miscalculated earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations because 3*(previous result) can get big quickly, and I might have messed up a multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so Level 9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Add them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check my levels again because I might have miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a level. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until there are 9 levels. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new level. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 levels of nesting. Therefore, my earlier calculation with 9 levels is correct. <nEwLiNe>So, Level 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each level is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 => a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations or the reasoning. The closed-form approach also leads to the same result, so it's a good check. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s all multiplied and added together. I think the way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down step by step. Maybe I'll label each level so I don't get confused. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. Let me note that as Level 1. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. So Level 2 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So Level 3 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 3*40 is 120, then 1 + 120 is 121. Level 4 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Level 5 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is... let me calculate that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 10 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3*364: 364 * 3. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 is 1093. Level 6 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. Level 7 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. Level 8 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. Level 9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost expression is 3(Level 9) = 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 29524 * 3. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now add them all up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Level 1: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think my calculation is right. Each step builds on the previous one, and I don't see any errors in the arithmetic. It was a bit tedious, but taking it step by step made it manageable. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions. <nEwLiNe>First, let me write down the expression clearly so I can see the structure: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's a series of 3 multiplied by a sum, which itself contains another 3 multiplied by another sum, and so on, nine times. That seems like a lot, but maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down. Starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3 multiplied by that result, plus 1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me assign each layer a step so I can compute them one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each innermost expression as step 1, then step 2, and so on until step 9, because I can see there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of times ""1 + 3"" appears. Each time, it's wrapped in another 3*(...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3*(1 + 3) + 1 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(result from step 2) + 1 <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, the original expression has 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so maybe it's 9 layers? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, wait, maybe I should just compute each step methodically. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each step as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me start from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 3*(1 + Step 1) + 1? Wait, no, looking again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each step is 1 + 3*(next step). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me number them from the inside out as step 1 to step 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, maybe the innermost is step 1, then each layer outwards is step 2, step 3, etc., up to step 9. <nEwLiNe>So, step 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>step 2: 3*(step1) + 1? Wait, no, looking at the structure: <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each step is 3*(previous step) + 1? Wait, let me think. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me actually write down each layer: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: 3*(4) + 1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me try: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote S(n) as the value of the nth step. <nEwLiNe>So, S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, S(2) = 3*(1 + S(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but wait, looking at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>S(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, S(2) = 3*(1 + S(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, S(3) = 3*(1 + S(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>S(4) = 3*(1 + S(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>S(5) = 3*(1 + S(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>S(6) = 3*(1 + S(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>S(7) = 3*(1 + S(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>S(8) = 3*(1 + S(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>S(9) = 3*(1 + S(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(S(9)).

So, S(9) would be the innermost, and the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*S(9)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + ... Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3*(...)"" is a layer, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let's count the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is the answer 88572? Hmm, that seems high, but let's check the steps again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount each layer carefully: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. So, maybe the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify with another approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution: characteristic equation r = 3, so homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume particular solution is constant C. <nEwLiNe>So, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I used two methods: iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I've got this expression to compute: 3 times a bunch of nested (1 + 3(...)) terms. It looks complicated with all those parentheses, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so it's 3 multiplied by something that's 1 plus another 3 times something, and this pattern repeats. I count nine sets of parentheses, so it's like a chain of 1 + 3(...), multiplied by 3 each time, and then the whole thing is multiplied by 3 again at the beginning. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me label each part to keep track. Let's say the innermost part is A, then the next one is B, and so on, up to the outermost part which is I. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3A <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>D = 1 + 3C <nEwLiNe>E = 1 + 3D <nEwLiNe>F = 1 + 3E <nEwLiNe>G = 1 + 3F <nEwLiNe>H = 1 + 3G <nEwLiNe>I = 1 + 3H <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3I. So, I need to compute each of these step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's straightforward. Now moving to B: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Got it. Now, C: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's getting bigger. Let's keep going: <nEwLiNe>D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3*12 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, wait. Let me check. 3*121 is 363, so E = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I miscalculated D. Let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>C was 40, so 3*C is 120, then D = 1 + 120 = 121. That's correct. Then E is 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, so E is 364. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to F: <nEwLiNe>F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's a big number. Now, G: <nEwLiNe>G = 1 + 3F = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then G = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then add 1: 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Now, H: <nEwLiNe>H = 1 + 3G = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Calculate 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then H = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving on to I: <nEwLiNe>I = 1 + 3H = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then I = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3I, so: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me just go through each step again quickly to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>D = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>F = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>G = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>H = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>I = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yeah, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations add up. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It's written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) and so on. Hmm, that looks like a lot of nested parentheses. I need to figure out how to compute this step by step. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions inside the parentheses. Each parenthesis starts with a 1 plus another term that's multiplied by 3. It seems like it's a recursive structure, but since it's only nested a certain number of times, I can probably compute it step by step, starting from the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s. Hmm, starting from the innermost, there's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3. Let me see, how many 3s are there? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, let's count the number of 3s. Each time it's 3*(...). So starting from the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 3), then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. Let me count the number of 3s. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. Continuing this way, each layer adds another 3. <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? Let me see: the innermost is the last 3, so each parenthesis adds a layer <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that seems too quick. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, I need to count the number of 3s. Wait, actually, each 3 is a multiplication, so each time, you have another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364.

Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>10. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, total layers inside: 9, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, that gives 88572 as the final result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>In general, for such a recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence, and we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + C <nEwLiNe>Where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>To find C, set a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>So, C = 1 + 3C <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3C both sides: -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, at layer n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each a_n can be written as 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )). <nEwLiNe>So, expanding it, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, because each time it's 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to a geometric series but with each term multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the closed-form we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is indeed the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, up to 3^n, divided by (3 - 1) = 2. <nEwLiNe>So, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is exactly what we have. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = S = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Let me just double-check my arithmetic in case I messed up somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested parentheses thing. Let me write it down to visualize it better. <nEwLiNe>It's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses. I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for nested expressions. So, let me count how many layers there are here. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: the first innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3 times something. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses! I need to figure out how to tackle this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down more clearly so I can see each layer: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, that result is multiplied by 3 and added to 1 in the next layer. <nEwLiNe>2. So, working from the inside out, I'll compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer.

So, if I let each level be a term in a sequence, where each term is 1 + 3*previous term. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Term1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Term2: 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 12 =13. <nEwLiNe>Term3:1 +3*Term2=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>Term4:1 +3*40=121. <nEwLiNe>Term5:1 +3*121=364. <nEwLiNe>Term6:1 +3*364=1093. <nEwLiNe>Term7:1 +3*1093=3280. <nEwLiNe>Term8:1 +3*3280=9841. <nEwLiNe>Term9:1 +3*9841=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total is 3*Term9=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can express this recursively. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of levels. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1) = 1 + 3 =4. <nEwLiNe>f(n) =1 +3*f(n-1). <nEwLiNe>But in our case, we have 9 levels, so f(9) =1 +3*f(8). <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*f(9). So, let me compute f(n) step by step. <nEwLiNe>f(1)=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7)=1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8)=1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9)=1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression: 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Same answer. So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each level is 1 + 3*previous level. So, if I unroll it, it's like: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can write it as a sum: <nEwLiNe>Each term is 3^k, but I'm not sure. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each time, the coefficient of 3 is increasing by a power. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I have f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>The particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution f_p. <nEwLiNe>Setting f_p =1 + 3*f_p => 1 =1 + 3*f_p - f_p => 1=1 + 2*f_p => 0=2*f_p => f_p=0. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is f(n)= A*3^n + 0. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition f(1)=4: 4 = A*3^1 => A=4/3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(n)= (4/3)*3^n =4*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>f(1)=4*3^{0}=4*1=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(2)=4*3^{1}=12. But wait, f(2)=13, not 12. Hmm, that's a problem. So, my particular solution was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe because the nonhomogeneous term is 1, and the homogeneous solution already includes a constant term, so I need to try a particular solution of a different form. Maybe a linear function. <nEwLiNe>Let me assume f_p = B*n + C. <nEwLiNe>Then, f_p =1 +3*f_p => B*n + C =1 +3*(B*n + C). <nEwLiNe>Expanding: Bn + C =1 + 3Bn +3C. <nEwLiNe>Bring all terms to left: Bn + C -1 -3Bn -3C=0 => (-2Bn -2C -1)=0. <nEwLiNe>This must hold for all n, so coefficients must be zero. <nEwLiNe>-2B=0 => B=0. <nEwLiNe>-2C -1=0 => C= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the particular solution is f_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is f(n)= A*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition f(1)=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 +1/2= 3A => 9/2=3A => A= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1}/2) -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check if this works. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so the formula f(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2 gives us the value at each level. So, for n=9, f(9)= (3^{10}-1)/2= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the result again. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could also compute this expression using a calculator step by step, but since I don't have a calculator here, I have to do it manually. But I think my step-by-step computation and the recursive formula both lead to the same result, so I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap: <nEwLiNe>1. Start from the innermost parentheses and work outward, computing each level step by step. <nEwLiNe>2. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(previous level). <nEwLiNe>3. After computing up to level 9, multiply the result by 3. <nEwLiNe>4. The result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative step-by-step method and the recursive formula method gave me the same result, so I feel confident that 88,572 is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s with a lot of multiplications and additions. I need to figure out how to compute this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3*(result from above). Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each level is 1 + 3*(next level). So each time, I compute the innermost expression first and then substitute it into the outer one. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to break it down step by step: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: Innermost (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: Next level is 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: Next level is 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: Next level is 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: Next level is 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3* <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, that seems too big. Maybe I need to be more careful. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 3)) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 4)) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 5)) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute 3*364. 364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: (1 + 3*(result from 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from 9) = 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: Let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, +1500 = 88500, +60 = 88560, +12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step because that's a lot of computations. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364: 3*364 = 1092; 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093: 3*1093 = 3279; 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280: 3*3280 = 9840; 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841: 3*9841 = 29523; 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524: 29524*3 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems correct. So the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think about this expression as a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting with 4, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1, it's a bit different. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such a nested expression. Maybe express it recursively. Let's denote each level as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, actually, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, up to a_9. Then the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3*C - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So that confirms the result is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which is similar to a base-3 number or something, but in this case, the recurrence relation approach worked well. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing step by step and verifying with the recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this math problem to solve: Compute \(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks like a nested expression with a lot of 3s and parentheses. It seems like each level is a multiplication by 3 and then adding something. I need to figure out how to approach this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Each time, it's multiplied by 3 again. So maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will be easier. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside, the innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>\(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{innermost part})\). So replacing the innermost part with 4, we have: <nEwLiNe>\(1 + 3(4)\) <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 4 = 12\) <nEwLiNe>Then, \(1 + 12 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{previous result})\). So that would be: <nEwLiNe>\(1 + 3(13)\) <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 13 = 39\) <nEwLiNe>Then, \(1 + 39 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>So now, that layer simplifies to 40. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each time, I take the previous result, multiply by 3, add 1, and that's the next layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step to keep track: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that's too big. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost \(1 + 3\), each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).

Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- Starting with 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then inside, 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does the pattern \(1 + 3(\) occur?

Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>- The entire expression starts with 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then inside, each 1+3( adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2.

Layer 9: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after 9 layers, starting from the innermost, we get 29524.

So 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000+2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*29524=88,572. So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>But wait, I just thought, is there a formula for such expressions? It seems like each layer is of the form \(a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). So, is this a recurrence relation? <nEwLiNe>Yes, actually, this is a linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for \(a_n\). <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is \(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: \(a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\). The characteristic equation is \(r - 3 = 0\), so \(r = 3\). Thus, the homogeneous solution is \(A \cdot 3^n\). <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say \(a_n = C\). Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>\(C = 1 + 3C\) <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>\(C - 3C = 1\) <nEwLiNe>\(-2C = 1\) <nEwLiNe>\(C = -\frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = A \cdot 3^n + (-\frac{1}{2})\) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, \(a_1 = 4\): <nEwLiNe>\(4 = A \cdot 3^1 - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>\(4 = 3A - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>\(4 + \frac{1}{2} = 3A\) <nEwLiNe>\(\frac{9}{2} = 3A\) <nEwLiNe>\(A = \frac{9}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3^n - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Or, <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, the value is \(\frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9: <nEwLiNe>\(a_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3^{10}\): <nEwLiNe>\(3^1 = 3\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^2 = 9\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^3 = 27\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^4 = 81\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^5 = 243\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^6 = 729\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^7 = 2187\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^8 = 6561\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^9 = 19683\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^{10} = 59049\) <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_9 = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \frac{59048}{2} = 29524\), which matches our previous result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by 29524, which is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm whether n=9 is correct. Since we started with layer 1 as the innermost, and we have 9 layers, so yes, n=9. Therefore, the computation is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, thinking recursively, each time the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is similar to a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, since each term is built upon the previous one, the recurrence approach is more straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how to approach this. It looks like a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form 1 + 3(something). Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works well with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me count how many layers there are. Each ""3("" adds a layer, and I think there are 9 layers here? Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" sequences: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers. So, we have 9 nested expressions, each of the form 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out one layer, Layer 8: 1 + <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, that's a big number. Let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 9). Since Layer 9 is 4, so Layer 8 is 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving out to Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*13. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364. Compute 3*364: 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 93*3=279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523, so total is 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 1). So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: 29524*3. Let's compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Wait, no, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct, but let me check the multiplication steps again to ensure I didn't make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000=60000. <nEwLiNe>3*9000=27000. <nEwLiNe>3*500=1500. <nEwLiNe>3*24=72. <nEwLiNe>Adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500. <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to be thorough, let me check the layers again step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so total 900+192=1092. So, 1 + 1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so total 3000+279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so total 9000+840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. 27000 + 2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without computing each layer step by step. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our problem, we have 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 9, which is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our earlier step-by-step, we started from layer 9 as (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1=4. Then layer 8 is a_2=13, etc. So, actually, in terms of the formula, layer n corresponds to a_n, so layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute a_9. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the step-by-step result where layer 1 (the outermost) was 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 1) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the formula, we can compute the value without stepping through each layer, which is more efficient, especially for larger numbers of layers. <nEwLiNe>But, for someone just starting out, stepping through each layer is a good way to ensure understanding and avoid mistakes. <nEwLiNe>So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

It looks like a bunch of 3s multiplied by expressions inside. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so replacing the innermost part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next innermost is (1 + 3(4)).

Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the final result is 88575. <nEwLiNe>But let me just go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 +3*40=1+120=121 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally:3*(1 +29524)=3*29525=88575. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the multiplication steps again: <nEwLiNe>3*4=12, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*13=39, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*40=120, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*121=363, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*364: 364*3=1092, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*1093: 1093*3=3279, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*3280: 3280*3=9840, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*9841: 9841*3=29523, yes. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the last step: 3*(1 + 29524) is 3*29525. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, I had: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3(9841)) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then 3*(1 + 29524) = 3*29525. <nEwLiNe>But when I did 29525 *3, I got 88575, but when I did 3*29524, I thought it was 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recast this. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29525*3: 29525*3. Let me compute 29525*3: <nEwLiNe>29525 * 3: <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, it's 88575. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 29524*3 is different: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>29524 *3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I think I made a mistake in the last step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, because in the expression, after we computed (1 + 3(9841))=29524, then the expression is 3*(29524 +1)? Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let's go back. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3(9841)). <nEwLiNe>Which is 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*(29524). Wait, 1 + 29523 is 29524, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3*29524, not 3*29525. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so my mistake was in the last step. I thought it was 3*(1 +29524)=3*29525, but actually, 1 +29524 is 29525, so 3*29525=88575. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 +29524 is 29525, correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 3*29525 is 88575. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought 3*29524 is 88572, but in reality, 29524*3 is 88572, and 29525*3 is 88575. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which is it? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's retrace the steps: <nEwLiNe>We had: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>We computed step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next:1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next:1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next:1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally:3*(1 +3*9841)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the 9th step, we had (1 +3*9841)=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial calculation, I mistakenly thought that the outermost expression was 3*(1 +29524)=3*29525, but in reality, the outermost expression is just 3*(result), where result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, when we get to the outermost layer, it's 3*(1 +3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))))). So, the outermost is 3*(...), where inside is 1 +3*(...). So, in the last step, when we computed 1 +3*9841=29524, then the outermost is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial calculation, I incorrectly thought that the outermost was 3*(1 +29524). But actually, the outermost is 3*(result), where result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check again. <nEwLiNe>After the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: 1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2:1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Step 3:1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Step 4:1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Step 5:1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Step 6:1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Step 7:1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>Step 8:1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>Step 9:1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*(29524)=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer is 88572, not 88575. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my first calculation, I mistakenly thought that the last step was 3*(1 +29524), but in reality, it's 3*(29524). Because the structure is 3*(1 +3*(...)), and the innermost computed to 29524, so 3*(29524)=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>I think I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of 3(...). Starting from the left, it's 3(...). Inside that, it's 1 +3(...), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times 3(1+3(...)) occurs: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 +3) <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer wraps another 3(1+3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 3(1 +3) <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3(1 +3( ... )) where ... is the above. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count how many 3s are multiplying: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3(...) layers is 9, right? Because each time we have 3(1 +3(...)), and the innermost is 3(1 +3). So, starting from the innermost, it's 3(1+3). Then each step out is another 3(1 +3(...)). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each 3( is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(, then inside that, another 3(, and so on, until the innermost 3(1 +3). So, let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>That's the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 3(...): layer 2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the innermost, which is layer 9: 3(1 +3) <nEwLiNe>So, total of 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from layer 1 (innermost): <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 +3) = 3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I started from the innermost as (1 +3)=4, then next layer as 1 +3*4=13, etc. <nEwLiNe>But if I think of each layer as 3*(1 + previous), then: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 +3)=12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 +12)=3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3:3*(1 +39)=3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4:3*(1 +120)=3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5:3*(1 +363)=3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6:3*(1 +1092)=3*1093=3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7:3*(1 +3279)=3*3280=9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8:3*(1 +9840)=3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9:3*(1 +29523)=3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's a different approach, but arrives at the same result. <nEwLiNe>So, in this approach, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from layer 1 as 3*(1 +3)=12, then layer 2=3*(1 +12)=39, etc., up to layer 9=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial approach, I thought the outermost was 3*(1 +29524)=88575, but actually, it's 3*(29524)=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I think I confused myself by thinking that the outermost is 3*(1 + something), but actually, the outermost is just 3*(something), where something is the result of the inner expression, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3*(1 +3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(result of inner expression). <nEwLiNe>So, when I computed the inner expression as 29524, the outermost is 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>To make sure, let me compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial confusion was thinking that the outermost was 3*(1 + something), but it's actually just 3*(something). Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's it. So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a repeated pattern where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to break this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work my way outward. Let me write down each step clearly. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3(result of step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3(result of step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>There are nine sets of parentheses here, so I think I need to compute this nine times. Let me start with the innermost one. <nEwLiNe>**Step 1: Compute the innermost parentheses** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have: <nEwLiNe>**Step 2: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 1) <nEwLiNe>So, that's 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now we have 13. <nEwLiNe>**Step 3: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 2) <nEwLiNe>That's 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>So now, it's 40. <nEwLiNe>**Step 4: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 3) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Got it, 121. <nEwLiNe>**Step 5: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 4) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe> <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that was Step 5? Let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 3*121 is 363, 363 + 1 is 364. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>**Step 6: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 5) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 1093. <nEwLiNe>**Step 7: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 6) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is... let me compute that. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>So, 3280. <nEwLiNe>**Step 8: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 7) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Alright, 9841. <nEwLiNe>**Step 9: Next layer** <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(result from Step 8) <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841: Let's compute 9841*3. <nEwLiNe>First, 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me confirm each step because I feel like I might have miscounted the number of steps. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from the innermost, that was Step 1, and I went up to Step 9. So, the outermost parentheses have been computed as 29524. <nEwLiNe>But remember, the entire expression is 3*(that result). So, after computing the innermost parentheses all the way out to get 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding all those together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4 + 4 = 8 <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9 + 9 + 1 = 19, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 + 1 = 5 <nEwLiNe>So, 59048. <nEwLiNe>Then, 59048 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>4 + 2 + 1 = 7 <nEwLiNe>0 + 5 = 5 <nEwLiNe>9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>5 + 2 + 1 = 8 <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step, each time I worked through the innermost parentheses first, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, until I reached the outermost parentheses, which gave me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times that, which is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that makes sense. Let me just recap: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right.

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). It seems like each layer is built by taking the previous one, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so innermost should be done first. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses, it seems like there are nine layers here. Each layer is another \(1 + 3(\text{...})\). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last \(1 + 3\), let me compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me list each layer from the innermost to the outermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: \(1 + 3\) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: \(1 + 3(\text{Layer 1})\) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: \(1 + 3(\text{Layer 2})\) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: \(1 + 3(\text{Layer 8})\) <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: \(1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \times 4\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I do the multiplication first before adding 1, as per the order of operations. <nEwLiNe>So Layer 2: \(1 + 3 \times <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, that's too big. Let me recast this. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, I think I made a miscalculation earlier.

Let me compute 3*364: <nEwLiNe>364 x 3: 4x3=12, 6x3=18, 3x3=9. So 9, 8 (from 18 + 1 carried over), 2 (from 12 + 1 carried over). Wait, no: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 364 x 3: <nEwLiNe>Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Tens place: 6*3=18 + 1=19, write 9, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Hundreds place: 3*3=9 +1=10, write 0, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>But since there are no more digits, we write the 1. So 364*3=1092.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 3s multiplying expressions that start with 1 and add 3 times another similar expression. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down more clearly, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested part as a step. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving outward, each step is 3 times (1 + 3 times the next step). Let's break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one step out: <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Step1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, Step1 is 4. Then, inside Step2, it's 1 + 3*(Step1). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, 3 times that is 39. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another step: <nEwLiNe>Step 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Step2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Okay, let me verify. Step2 was 39. So, 1 + 3*39 = 1 + 117 = 118. Then, 3*118 = 354. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Next step: <nEwLiNe>Step 4: 3*(1 + 3*(Step3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 1 + 1062 is 106 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on. Let me calculate 1 + 1062 first. That's 1063. Then, 3*1063. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>1063 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 60*3=180, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 180 + 9 = 3189. So, Step4 is 3189. <nEwLiNe>Moving on: <nEwLiNe>Step 5: 3*(1 + 3*(Step4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 <nEwLiNe>Calculating 9568*3: 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 60*3=180, 8*3=24. Adding them up: 27000 + 1500 = 28500; 28500 + 180 = 28680; 28680 + 24 = 28704. So, Step5 is 28704. <nEwLiNe>Next step: <nEwLiNe>Step 6: 3*(1 + 3*(Step5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 <nEwLiNe>Compute 86113*3: 80000*3=240000, 6000*3=18000, 100*3=300, 13*3=39. Adding them: 240000 + 18000 = 258000; 258000 + 300 = 258300; 258300 + 39 = 258339. So, Step6 is 258339. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>Step 7: 3*(1 + 3*(Step6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 <nEwLiNe>Calculate 775018*3: 700000*3=2100000, 70000*3=210000, 5000*3=15000, 18*3=54. Adding them: 2100000 + 210000 = 2310000; 2310000 + 15000 = 2325000; 2325000 + 54 = 2325054. So, Step7 is 2325054. <nEwLiNe>Next step: <nEwLiNe>Step 8: 3*(1 + 3*(Step7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 <nEwLiNe>Compute 6975163*3: Let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>6,000,000*3 = 18,000,000 <nEwLiNe>900,000*3 = 2,700,000 <nEwLiNe>70,000*3 = 210,000 <nEwLiNe>5,000*3 = 15,000 <nEwLiNe>100*3 = 300 <nEwLiNe>60*3 = 180 <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 6,975,163 is the number. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 6,975,163: Let's compute each digit multiplied by 3: <nEwLiNe>6*3=18 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 <nEwLiNe>7*3=21 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15 <nEwLiNe>1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>6*3=18 <nEwLiNe>3*3=9 <nEwLiNe>But that's if we do digit by digit.

So, Step9 is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on. Let me make sure that Step8 was correctly calculated. Because Step8 is 3*(1 + 3*Step7). Step7 was 2,325,054. So, 3*2,325,054 = 6,975,162. Then, 1 + 6,975,162 = 6,975,163. Then, 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. So, that's correct. Then, moving to Step9, 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489). 3*20,925,489 is 62,776,467. 1 + 62,776,467 is 62,776,468. Then, 3*62,776,468 is 188,329,404. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, now, since we have nine layers, right? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, Step1 is (1+3). Then, each Step2 through Step9 corresponds to each layer. So, in total, we have nine layers, meaning the entire expression is Step9, which is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Step1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + 3*...). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) - that's layer 1 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 3*(1 + 3*(layer1)) - that's layer2 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 3*(1 + 3*(layer2)) - layer3 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, until the outermost layer, which is layer9. <nEwLiNe>So, total layers are 9, meaning the entire expression is layer9, which is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure. When I count the number of times 3 is multiplied, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) sections: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Total of 9 times. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so layer1 is 3*(1 + 3), layer2 is 3*(1 + 3*(layer1)), and so on up to layer9. <nEwLiNe>So, Step1 was (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Step3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Step4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Step5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Step6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Step7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Step8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, earlier I had Step8 as 20,925,489, but when I computed Step9, it was 188,329,404. Wait, let me check Step8 again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in Step7, I had 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, Step8: 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is Step9 equal to 188,329,404? But in my earlier step-by-step, I thought Step9 was the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*Step8). But wait, actually, in the original expression, the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) is 9, right? So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, meaning the outermost layer is the 9th step, which is 3*(1 + 3*Step8), which we computed as 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations because these numbers get really big really fast. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to calculate each step manually, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, we can write: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 is 188,329,404, which matches my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute a few steps again: <nEwLiNe>Starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Yes, all steps check out. So, the final result is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 9*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 9*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r = 9. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*9^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3 + 9*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 9C = 3 => -8C = 3 => C = -3/8 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*9^n + (-3/8) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*9^1 + (-3/8) => 4 = 9A - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>9A = 4 + 3/8 = 35/8 <nEwLiNe>A = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>We can write 9^n as 9*9^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to just compute it as is. <nEwLiNe>Now, let's compute a_9 using this formula: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>First, compute 9^9: <nEwLiNe>9^1 = 9 <nEwLiNe>9^2 = 81 <nEwLiNe>9^3 = 729 <nEwLiNe>9^4 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>9^5 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>9^6 = 531441 <nEwLiNe>9^7 = 4782969 <nEwLiNe>9^8 = 43046721 <nEwLiNe>9^9 = 387420489 <nEwLiNe>So, 9^9 = 387,420,489 <nEwLiNe>Now, compute (35/72)*387,420,489: <nEwLiNe>First, 387,420,489 / 72 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 387,420,489 ÷ 72: <nEwLiNe>72*5,000,000 = 360,000,000 <nEwLiNe>387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489 <nEwLiNe>72*380,000 = 27,360,000 <nEwLiNe>27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489 <nEwLiNe>72*839 = 60,489 (since 72*800=57,600; 72*39=2,808; 57,600 + 2,808 = 60,408; wait, 72*839=72*(800+39)=57,600 + 2,808=60,408. Hmm, but we have 60,489. So, 60,489 - 60,408 = 81. So, 72*1=72. 81 -72=9. So, total is 839 + 1 = 840, and 9/72=1/8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should use a calculator approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since 72 = 8*9, and 387,420,489 is divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits is 3+8+7+4+2+0+4+8+9=47, which is not divisible by 9. Wait, actually, 387,420,489 divided by 9 is 43,046,721, since 9*43,046,721=387,420,489. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>43,046,721 * 9: <nEwLiNe>40,000,000 *9=360,000,000 <nEwLiNe>3,000,000*9=27,000,000 <nEwLiNe>46,000*9=414,000 <nEwLiNe>700*9=6,300 <nEwLiNe>20*9=180 <nEwLiNe>1*9=9 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>360,000,000 +27,000,000=387,000,000 <nEwLiNe>387,000,000 +414,000=387,414,000 <nEwLiNe>387,414,000 +6,300=387,420,300 <nEwLiNe>387,420,300 +180=387,420,480 <nEwLiNe>387,420,480 +9=387,420,489 <nEwLiNe>Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 387,420,489 ÷72 = (387,420,489 ÷9) ÷8 = 43,046,721 ÷8 <nEwLiNe>Compute 43,046,721 ÷8: <nEwLiNe>8*5,000,000=40,000,000 <nEwLiNe>43,046,721 -40,000,000=3,046,721 <nEwLiNe>8*380,000=3,040,000 <nEwLiNe>3,046,721 -3,040,000=6,721 <nEwLiNe>8*840=6,720 <nEwLiNe>6,721 -6,720=1 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 5,000,000 +380,000 +840 +1/8 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 43,046,721 ÷8=5,380,840.125 <nEwLiNe>So, 35/72 *387,420,489 =35 *5,380,840.125= ? <nEwLiNe>Compute 35 *5,380,840.125: <nEwLiNe>First, 5,380,840.125 *35 <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>5,380,840 *35 +0.125*35 <nEwLiNe>5,380,840 *35: <nEwLiNe>Compute 5,380,840 *30=161,425,200 <nEwLiNe>5,380,840 *5=26,904,200 <nEwLiNe>Total=161,425,200 +26,904,200=188,329,400 <nEwLiNe>0.125*35=4.375 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 188,329,400 +4.375=188,329,404.375 <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3/8: <nEwLiNe>a_9 =188,329,404.375 - 0.375=188,329,404 <nEwLiNe>Yes!

Alright, so I've got this math problem here that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it won't be so bad. Let me write it out again to make sure I have it right: <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like there are nine sets of parentheses, each containing \(1 + 3\) multiplied by something else. Hmm, maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Each time I see a ""("", that's a new layer. Let me number them from the inside out: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1 + 3\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from layer 1})\) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: \(1 + 3(\text{result from layer 2})\) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, if I start with the innermost, which is just \(1 + 3\), that should be straightforward. <nEwLiNe>**Layer 1:** \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that gives me 4. Now, moving one layer out, I have another expression: \(1 + 3(\text{result from layer 1})\). Since layer 1 gave me 4, this becomes: <nEwLiNe>**Layer 2:** \(1 + 3 \times 4\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, I need to remember the order of operations here. Multiplication comes before addition, so I should compute \(3 \times 4\) first. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: \(3 \times 4 = 12\). Then add 1: \(1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>So, layer 2 gives me 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's again \(1 + 3(\text{result from layer 2})\). Plugging in 13: <nEwLiNe>**Layer 3:** \(1 + 3 \times 13\) <nEwLiNe>Again, multiplication first: \(3 \times 13 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, that doesn't make sense. 3 times 13 is 39, right? So, 1 + 39 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, so layer 3 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems too big. Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire expression. So after layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have messed up somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me verify with a different approach. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form \(1 + 3n\), where n is the result from the previous layer. So, starting from 1, each subsequent layer is \(1 + 3*(previous result)\). <nEwLiNe>This actually resembles a geometric series. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as \(a_k\), where \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\), \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1\), \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2\), and so on up to \(a_9\). Then the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, the recursive formula is \(a_{k} = 1 + 3a_{k-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for \(a_k\). <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence \(a_k = c + r*a_{k-1}\) is \(a_k = r^{k-1}a_1 + c*(r^{k-1} - 1)/(r - 1)\). <nEwLiNe>In this case, c = 1, r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_k = 3^{k-1}*4 + 1*(3^{k-1} - 1)/(3 - 1)\). <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>\(a_k = 4*3^{k-1} + (3^{k-1} - 1)/2\) <nEwLiNe>Combine terms: <nEwLiNe>\(a_k = (8*3^{k-1} + 3^{k-1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{k-1} - 1)/2\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, 8*3^{k-1} + 3^{k-1} is 9*3^{k-1}, right? So, yes, \(a_k = (9*3^{k-1} - 1)/2\). <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>\(9*3^{k-1} = 3^{2}*3^{k-1} = 3^{k+1}\). So, <nEwLiNe>\(a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check this formula with the earlier results. <nEwLiNe>For k=1: \(a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For k=2: \(a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For k=3: \(a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, seems like the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, \(a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2\). <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3^{10}\): <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\). Yep, matches my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step once more: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5.

Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent.

Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s all multiplied together in some pattern. I need to figure out what this equals. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should try to simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. Let me write it out more clearly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that, the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Wait, hold on, is it 1 + 3 times the result? Or is it 1 + 3 multiplied by something else? Let me make sure I parse this correctly. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... ))). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by the next layer). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the inside, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). <nEwLiNe>Let me write this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting the number of 1s and 3s, it's nine sets of (1 + 3(...)).

So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, as I did before. <nEwLiNe>So let's define: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3*(...), so it's 3 multiplied by L9, where L9 is <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but I need to compute it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of (1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me index them as L1 to L9, with L1 being the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify that step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 3: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right. <nEwLiNe>So the total is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers, let me check each step again. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So yeah, it seems like 88,572 is the correct result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer is following a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>Given that each L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution would be L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2K = 1 <nEwLiNe>K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer L_n, it's equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for L1: n=1, L1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, indeed, the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches what I found earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute it step by step or use the recurrence relation formula, I end up with the same result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again to confirm. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 59049 -1 = 59048. <nEwLiNe>Divided by 2 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that again. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>     2 9 5 2 4 <nEwLiNe>   x         3 <nEwLiNe>   ------------ <nEwLiNe>     8 8 5 7 2 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, all the steps check out. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 3s and 1s multiplied and added together in a recursive way. Hmm, okay, let's try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it will make more sense. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3( something ). Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the next layer. So, each time, we have a similar pattern: 1 + 3*(previous result).  <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down as a sequence of computations. Maybe if I denote each nested expression as a term in a sequence, it will help. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Let a₁ = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ <nEwLiNe>And so on, until a₉, since there are nine layers of 3s and parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the ninth layer. So, yeah, nine terms in the sequence. <nEwLiNe>So, a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, let me check that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the count. Let me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is a₁, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let's count the number of a's. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, nine layers. Therefore, a₁ through a₉. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each a step by step. <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*a₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*a₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*a₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*a₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so a₉ is 29524. But hold on, the original expression is 3*(a₉). Because the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3(...)), which is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my computations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting from a₁: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (correct) <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (correct) <nEwLiNe>3*a₉ = 3*29524 = 88572 (correct) <nEwLiNe>Okay, seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's a geometric progression of sorts, but with each term depending on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation where each term aₙ = 1 + 3*aₙ₋₁, with a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This kind of recurrence can be solved explicitly. The general solution for such a linear recurrence is aₙ = A*3ⁿ + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>But since we only need up to a₉, computing step by step is straightforward and less error-prone for me. <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, 88572 is the result. I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. Maybe I'll start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be easy. 1 plus 3 is 4. Let me write that down. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving up another level, it's 1 + 3 times the previous result, which is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and then adding 1. It seems like a pattern here. Maybe I can keep track of each step. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to tabulate these results to make it clearer. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure I didn't skip a step or miscalculate somewhere.

But the original expression only has eight sets of parentheses after the first 3. Let me check how many times we have to compute this. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: let's see, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is one level.

So, actually, f(1) is (1 + 3) = 4, then f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 13, and so on until f(9) = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(f(9)). <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me confirm that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I had f(9) = 29,524, which is the result of the innermost expression after 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating f(9), let me recount: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the function f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + C, where A is a constant determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>Given f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: f_h(n) = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume f_p(n) = B. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Solving for B: <nEwLiNe>B - 3B = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 <nEwLiNe>B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, f(9) = (3^10 - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2,187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59,049 <nEwLiNe>So, f(9) = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier calculation. Good. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the inner expression is 29,524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step again, but using the closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>f(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1) = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(3)=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(4)=(3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(5)=3^6 -1=729-1=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(6)=3^7 -1=2187-1=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(7)=3^8 -1=6561-1=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(8)=3^9 -1=19683-1=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>f(9)=3^10 -1=59049-1=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all steps check out. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, multiplying by 3 gives 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>I think I've double-checked it enough. So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. By recognizing the pattern and using a recursive approach, we determine that the inner expression evaluates to 29,524. Multiplying this result by 3 gives the final answer of 88,572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"
