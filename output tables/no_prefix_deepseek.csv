 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, it looks like a nested expression with a lot of parentheses. Let me try to parse it step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of nested 1 + 3 terms, each multiplied by 3. It seems repetitive, so maybe there's a pattern or a way to simplify it without computing each layer individually. But since I'm not sure, I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be easy. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, that layer is 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3(40). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, now we have 121. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Hmm, getting bigger quickly. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(364). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3(1093). Let's compute that: 3 * 1093 = 3279, plus 1 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Another layer: 1 + 3(3280). 3 * 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward: 1 + 3(9841). 3 * 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(29524). 3 * 29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count how many layers I've done so far. Starting from the innermost, each time I worked outwards, I did 9 layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each layer adds another set. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Yes, 9 layers. So, when I simplified each step, I ended up with 88573 as the innermost result. But wait, each time I did a layer, I was computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, the innermost becomes 88573, and then I have one more 3 multiplied by that, right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )). So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outwards, each time we're computing 1 + 3*(previous result). <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I need to do 9 iterations of this 1 + 3*(result) operation, starting from 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after 9 layers, starting from the innermost, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. So, 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29000 * 3 is 87000, 524 * 3 is 1572, so adding together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I was computing layer by layer, I had 88573 as the result before the final multiplication. But now, I see that after 9 layers, it's 29524, then multiplied by 3 is 88572. Hmm, seems like I might have miscounted earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so after 9 layers, it's 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, which is 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I thought I had 9 layers, but when I was computing, I ended up with 88573, which seems conflicting. Maybe I messed up the count earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the initial 3 is outside all the parentheses. So, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting with 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 1 + 3*13=40, etc., up to 9 layers, which gives 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought I had 9 layers and ended up with 88573, but now, following this structure, it's 88572. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, it's 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, so 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute this step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 8 8 5 7 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let me compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>Units place: 4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>Tens place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. <nEwLiNe>Hundreds place: 5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>Thousands place: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>Ten-thousands place: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I was computing each layer, I thought I ended up with 88573, but that must have been a miscalculation. Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 88573, but that was without considering the final multiplication by 3. Wait, no, actually, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I confused the number of layers. Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections: starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). So, how many times does 1 + 3 get nested? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3(1 + 3( ... )) adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>10. ...1 + 3)))))... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I thought I had 9 layers, I ended up with 88573, which is incorrect because I must have miscounted the layers or added an extra 1 somewhere. But now, following the step-by-step, it's clear that after 9 layers, we get 29524, then multiplied by 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me write down each layer with the corresponding step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think I can confidently say the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such nested expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers, starting from a_1 = 4, we have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches our earlier computation. So, using the recurrence relation and finding the closed-form solution confirms that the result is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer follows the pattern 1 + 3*(previous result). Starting from the innermost layer and working outward, each step is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiplying by 3 gives: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 29524 = 88572\) <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this. It looks like a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward. That usually works well with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step. Let's label each level for clarity. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Level 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting the number of parentheses, I see there are 9 sets of parentheses starting from the innermost. So, that means there are 9 levels. Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: (1 + 3*(previous)) <nEwLiNe>3. Continue this until the 9th level. <nEwLiNe>So, I'll compute each level step by step. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the Level 9 result, right? <nEwLiNe>Because the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression. So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, the final result is 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>First, let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>Calculate 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>x    3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>Compute each digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. Hmm, but let me cross-verify this with another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29524 * 3 can be computed as: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524 + 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me add 29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>4 + 4 = 8. <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>5 + 5 = 10, write 0, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>9 + 9 = 18 + 1 = 19, write 9, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 = 4 + 1 = 5. <nEwLiNe>So, that gives 59048. <nEwLiNe>Now, add another 29524 to 59048: <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>8 + 4 = 12, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>4 + 2 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>0 + 5 = 5. <nEwLiNe>9 + 9 = 18, write 8, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>5 + 2 = 7 + 1 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, that gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, let me make sure that I computed each Level correctly. Maybe I made an error in one of the steps. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Level 1: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, each level is 3*previous + 1. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing all 9 levels, we get 29524, then multiply by 3, giving 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, I just noticed that in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... is the entire nested expression. So, the computation is correct because I computed the innermost, then each layer, then multiplied the outermost by 3. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). So, it's a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each level as a_n, where n is the level number. So, a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, for n >= 2, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. <nEwLiNe>For n = 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n = 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n = 3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 4: (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 6: (2187 -1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 7: (6561 -1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 8: (19683 -1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 9: (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, the formula works for all levels. So, the 9th level is 29524, as I computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I use the formula, since a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144 / 2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or use the closed-form expression, I get the same answer: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks like a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 3 = 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I parse this correctly. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: each layer is 1 + 3(...). So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3*(13) is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay, moving on. <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Tenth layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on a second. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Each time I go out, it's another layer. So, let me count: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, that would be 10 layers in total? Wait, no. Wait, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the layers step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 9 layers inside, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1, then finally multiplying the last result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080 +12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270 +9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 +840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 +2400=29400 +120=29520 +3=29523. Then, 1 +29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(29524). Compute that: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524*3 step by step: <nEwLiNe>20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 +27000=87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 +1500=88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 +60=88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 +12=88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again—did I count the layers correctly? The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses: each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" before the first closing parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe another approach: Let me write the expression as: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time we have a 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" before the first closing parenthesis: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers inside, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), and then finally multiplying the 9th result by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers, each computed step by step as I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 3=4 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me compute each step again: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something, but given the structure, it's more of a repeated multiplication and addition. Let me see if there's a pattern or formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 1, each time it's 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous term. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost term is 4, which is a_1=4, then a_2=1 + 3*a_1=13, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4 <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^{n} + C <nEwLiNe>Where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve it step by step. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3=0 => r=3 <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = B*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution, a_n^{(p)}. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a constant solution, a_n^{(p)}=C <nEwLiNe>Plug into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = B*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = B*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3B - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3B => 9/2 = 3B => B= (9/2)/3= 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, that's the formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given that, for each layer, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., we can compute a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check with n=1: a_1=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches what I got earlier. Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms it. So, regardless of computing step by step or using the recurrence relation, I get the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way someone might approach this problem. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, someone might try to compute each layer step by step without recognizing the pattern, which is what I did initially, and it works, but it's more time-consuming and prone to arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, recognizing the pattern as a geometric progression with each term multiplied by 3 and added 1, leading to the recurrence, is a more efficient way. <nEwLiNe>But since the number of layers isn't too large (only 9), computing step by step is manageable, though a bit tedious. <nEwLiNe>Another thought: if I were to write a simple program or use a calculator, I could compute this expression quickly, but since I'm doing it manually, step by step is the way. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure, let me recompute 3^{10} to ensure I didn't make a mistake there. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. 3^10 is 59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. Let me write it down to see it clearly: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost part. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). Since each layer is similar, maybe there's a pattern or a way to express this recursively. But since I'm just starting out, maybe I'll tackle it layer by layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1 + 3, right? So that's the first layer. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the first layer. <nEwLiNe>3. This pattern continues, so each time we go out a layer, we're adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9.

The original expression was: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, each step I calculated the next layer by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Then, after nine layers, I multiplied by 3 one more time. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2 <nEwLiNe>So, we have a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with the earlier computations. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the closed-form formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the innermost layer, which is n=9, a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with my earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the formula, it's 3*a_9, which is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 =3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11=177147 <nEwLiNe>So, (3^{11} -3)/2 = (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 =88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. So, that's another way to compute it. <nEwLiNe>But since the problem didn't specify the form, just to compute it, and we've done it step-by-step and via the formula, both leading to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a chain of 1s and 3s multiplied together. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward.  <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of 1s and 3s nested inside each other, each time multiplied by 3. It might help to start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one. Let me write down the expression from the inside out: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost part: (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me define: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so maybe there are nine layers? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, there are 9 sets. So, yes, there are 9 layers. That means I need to compute from the innermost (Layer 9) up to the outermost (Layer 1). Wait, maybe I had it backwards earlier. Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if there are 9 layers, I need to compute from Layer 1 to Layer 9. Let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1. Then moving outward, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous expression). So, if there are 9 layers, we have Layer 1: (1 + 3), Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1), and so on up to Layer 9. So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we need to multiply it by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>Then, 20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>Then, 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems consistent. But let me verify the multiplication for Layer 9: <nEwLiNe>3*9841: 9841*3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. <nEwLiNe>Adding together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: Let's compute digit by digit. <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all steps check out. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula or recognizing a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is defined by a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition: when n=1, L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer n is equal to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer 9, which is the innermost layer, wait no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was (1 + 3) = 4, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer n corresponds to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. Perfect. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(Layer 9), and Layer 9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the total expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11=177147 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Which is the same result. So that confirms it. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I considered both computing step by step and finding a closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. So, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3 times a big nested expression. Let me write it down to visualize better. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested 1 + 3s. It seems like it's a repeated pattern where each time, you have 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me start from the innermost part. The innermost expression is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 is 4. So, let me note that. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the next layer out is 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3 times this 13. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that layer gives us 40. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*40. Let's calculate that. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 121? That seems a bit big, but okay. Let me keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Hmm, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, next layer is 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093 first. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9, so total is 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let me compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240, so total is 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the outermost layer is 3 times that result. So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 60 = 88560, 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 3*29524 is 88572? <nEwLiNe>Let me verify that calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524   <nEwLiNe>x        3   <nEwLiNe>________   <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. Okay, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression has nine layers of 1 + 3(...). Let me count them. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3s. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to nine times? Wait, actually, each time you have a 1 + 3 multiplied by the next layer. So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me parse the expression. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each time you have a 1 + 3, and then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3). That's 1 layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each time, moving out, you have another 1 + 3*(...). So: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 (1 layer) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (2 layers) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (3 layers) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (4 layers) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (5 layers) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (6 layers) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (7 layers) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (8 layers) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (9 layers) <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3 times that 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems correct. So, 88,572 is the result. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer step by step, in case I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, we can model this as a recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let me try to find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Let's plug in the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Plug into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right-hand side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, left-hand side: A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Right-hand side: 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Set them equal: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general term is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms the result. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think about this expression, it's a geometric series inside out. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), which is similar to building a geometric progression. The formula we derived is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the sum of a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 1, for n+1 terms. <nEwLiNe>But since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), it's a bit different, but the formula still holds. <nEwLiNe>So, with n=9 layers, we get (3^{10} - 1)/2, and multiplying by 3 gives 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Alright, so I've got this math problem here: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance with all those nested parentheses. But maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Let me start by looking at the structure. It seems like a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form 3(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer wraps another 3(1 + ...) around it. Maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside and working my way out. That seems logical. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 equals 4. Got that. So, the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Alright, moving one layer out, now we have 1 + 12. 1 + 12 is 13. Then, the next layer is 3 times 13, which is 39. Hmm, this seems to be building up. Let me write down each step so I don't get lost. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next layer: 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Next layer: 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Next layer: 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Next layer: 3 * 88573 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>21. Next: 1 + 265719 = 265720 <nEwLiNe>22. Next layer: 3 * 265720 = 797160 <nEwLiNe>23. Next: 1 + 797160 = 797161 <nEwLiNe>24. Next layer: 3 * 797161 = 2391483 <nEwLiNe>25. Next: 1 + 2391483 = 2391484 <nEwLiNe>26. Finally, the outermost layer: 3 * 2391484 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me count how many layers there are. Each ""3("" adds a layer, so starting from the innermost, I think there are 9 layers of 3(1 + ...). Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ). So, each ""3("" after the first one adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3(1 + ...):  <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers. Therefore, I should have 9 computations where each is 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13, 3*13=39, 1 + 39=40, 3*40=120, 1 + 120=121, 3*121=363, 1 + 363=364, 3*364=1092, 1 + 1092=1093, 3*1093=3279, 1 + 3279=3280, 3*3280=9840, 1 + 9840=9841, 3*9841=29523, 1 + 29523=29524, 3*29524=88572, 1 + 88572=88573, 3*88573=265719, 1 + 265719=265720, 3*265720=797160, 1 + 797160=797161, 3*797161=2391483, 1 + 2391483=2391484, and finally 3*2391484. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. If there are 9 layers, then starting from the innermost, we have 9 multiplications by 3, and 9 additions of 1. But when I counted, I think I went beyond 9 layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer consists of both a 3*(...) and a 1 + ..., so each layer actually has two operations. Hmm, maybe I confused the number of operations with the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me try a different approach. Let's define the expression recursively. Let me denote E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3(1 + 3). Then E_2 = 3(1 + E_1), and so on, up to E_9. <nEwLiNe>So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>E_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>E_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems different from my earlier counting. So according to this, E_9 is 88572. But when I was computing step by step before, I ended up at 2391483. Hmm, so I must have miscounted the number of layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let me clarify. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... 9 times ... )))). So, each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, E_1 is 3(1 + 3), E_2 is 3(1 + E_1), and so on until E_9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in this case, E_1 is 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>E_2 is 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>E_3 is 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>E_4 is 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>E_5 is 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E_6 is 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E_7 is 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E_8 is 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E_9 is 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I was expanding step by step, I ended up with 2391483. So, where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>Let me see. I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. When I started computing, I thought there were 9 layers, but perhaps I actually have more. Wait, let me look again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3("" after the first one. Starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. So: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers. So, according to this, E_9 is 88572, as above. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483, which is 3*(1 + 2391483 - 3). Wait, that seems inconsistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I miscounted the number of layers. So, if I use the recursive approach with E_n, and compute up to E_9, I get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe the expression is longer? Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>""Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))"" <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, the number of 3(1 + ...) is 9. So, the recursion goes up to E_9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I continued beyond 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see. Let me write out the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers. So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But when I was expanding earlier, I kept going beyond that, which suggests that maybe I miscounted the number of layers. So, perhaps the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm by another method. Maybe there's a formula for such expressions. <nEwLiNe>I recall that expressions of the form a(1 + a(1 + a(1 + ...))) can sometimes be represented as a geometric series or have a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>E_4 = 3*(1 + E_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>E_5 = 3*(1 + E_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E_6 = 3*(1 + E_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E_7 = 3*(1 + E_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E_8 = 3*(1 + E_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E_9 = 3*(1 + E_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, E_9 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 12. <nEwLiNe>So, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's see if we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>With E_1 = 12 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2A = 3 <nEwLiNe>A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition E_1 = 12: <nEwLiNe>12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>12 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>12 + 1.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>13.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>C = 13.5 / 3 = 4.5 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = 4.5*3^n - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>4.5 is 9/2, and 1.5 is 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, E_n = (9/2)*3^n - (3/2) <nEwLiNe>Factor out 3/2: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check that: <nEwLiNe>(3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but our general solution was E_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Which is (9*3^n - 3)/2 = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 9*3^n is 3^{n+2}, so: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, E_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this with n=1: <nEwLiNe>E_1 = (3^{3} - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>E_2 = (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>E_3 = (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^11: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11 = 177147 <nEwLiNe>So, E_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Perfect, that matches the earlier result. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 2391483. So, where did that come from? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. If I compute E_11, that would be (3^{13} - 3)/2, which is (1594323 - 3)/2 = 1594320/2 = 797160. Wait, but that's not matching 2391483 either. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^12 is 531441, 3^13 is 1594323, 3^14 is 4782969, 3^15 is 14348907. Hmm, 2391483 is 3^12 * something? Wait, 2391483 divided by 3 is 797161, which is a prime number? Maybe not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I was confused with the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original problem, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent 3(1 + ...) adds another layer. So, let's count the number of 3(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is just an addition, not a 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving out, the first 3*(...) is 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>- Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>- Then 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers of 3*(...), each adding one more layer. So, E_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I was computing step by step, I had 23 layers. Wait, no, that was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the exact structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) ) <nEwLiNe>So, let's parse it: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each ""3("" adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3("" after the first one: <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 instances of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the expression has 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial step-by-step was correct up to E_9 = 88572, but then I continued beyond that, which was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my first approach, I had 23 layers, but that was a mistake. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted because each ""3("" adds a layer, but the initial 3( is the first layer, and then each additional 3( adds another. So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 0. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3) is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + layer1) is layer2. <nEwLiNe>And so on, until we have layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, layer1 is 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>layer2 is 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>layer3 is 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>layer4 is 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>layer5 is 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>layer6 is 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>layer7 is 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>layer8 is 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>layer9 is 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so layer9 is 88572, which is the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, to confirm, using the formula E_n = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, with n=9: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion earlier was because I miscounted the number of layers, thinking there were more, but actually, it's 9 layers. So, 88572 is the correct result. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a repeated pattern where each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let's identify the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the next inner expression). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 3(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 3(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 3(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has multiple layers of 3(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving out, it's 3(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, 3(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, 3(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, 3(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, 3(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, 3(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, 3(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, 3(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's nine layers? Let me check: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, each time I compute a layer, I go one step out. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) is the innermost, not a 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>2. Then, the next is 3(1 + 4) <nEwLiNe>3. Then, 3(1 + 15) <nEwLiNe>4. Then, 3(1 + 48) <nEwLiNe>5. Then, 3(1 + 147) <nEwLiNe>6. Then, 3(1 + 444) <nEwLiNe>7. Then, 3(1 + 1335) <nEwLiNe>8. Then, 3(1 + 4008) <nEwLiNe>9. Then, 3(1 + 12027) <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer is 3(1 + 36084) ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). Each time, a new 3(1 + ...). So, how many 3(1 + ...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the left: 3(1 + ...). Each time, inside the parentheses, there's another 3(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. Repeating until the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many 3s are there? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>- The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Repeating until the innermost is just 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), so each layer is 3(1 + previous result). So, starting from (1 + 3), which is the innermost, and each layer is 3(1 + result). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each time a new 3(1 + ...) is added. Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that each 3(1 + ...) adds a layer. The expression is written with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so perhaps 9 layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, the outermost layer is 3(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 10 layers? Because starting from (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent 3(1 + ...) adds a layer, so from 1 to 10. <nEwLiNe>But let me check the original expression again: it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3(1 + ...). So, how many 3(1 + ...) are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is not a 3(1 + ...), so starting from the first 3(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>So, let me see, the number of 3(1 + ...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps another approach: the expression can be represented as a nested function f(n) = 3(1 + f(n-1)), where f(1) = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, f(1) would be (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, f(2) = 3(1 + f(1)) = 3*5 = 15. Then, f(3) = 3(1 + f(2)) = 3*16 = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times do we apply this function? Starting from f(1) = 4, then f(2), f(3), ..., up to f(n). Let's see how many layers are in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is f(1) = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is f(k) = 3(1 + f(k-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s in the expression. Let's count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). Each time, there's a 3 before a parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3): <nEwLiNe>From the left: 3, then inside that, another 3, and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many 3s? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 3. The innermost is (1 + 3), so the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with n layers. Each layer adds a 3(1 + ...). The innermost is (1 + 3), so that's layer 1: f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, layer 2: f(2) = 3(1 + f(1)) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: f(3) = 3(1 + f(2)) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3). Let me count: <nEwLiNe>From the left: 3, then another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, another 3, and finally (1 + 3). So, that's 9 layers of 3(1 + ...), starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, it's 1 layer: (1 + 3). Then, each 3(1 + ...) adds a layer. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s in the expression minus 1, perhaps? <nEwLiNe>Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should write out the expression with indices. <nEwLiNe>Let me define f(k) as follows: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>f(10) = 3(1 + f(9)) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if f(1) is the innermost, then f(10) is the outermost layer. So, the original expression is f(10). Therefore, the value is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. f(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. f(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. f(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. f(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. f(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. f(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. f(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>10. f(10) = 3*(1 + f(9)) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the value of the expression is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. Sometimes when I do multiple steps, I might make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>Let me recalculate each step: <nEwLiNe>1. f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3. f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>4. f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>5. f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>6. f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>7. f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>8. f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>9. f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>10. f(10) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>All the steps check out. So, the final result is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. <nEwLiNe>The expression is of the form f(n) = 3(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for f(n). <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is f(n) = 3f(n-1) + 3, with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's write it properly: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) = 3 + 3f(n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, f(n) = 3f(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 3f(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. The nonhomogeneous term is 3, which is a constant. Let's assume a constant particular solution, say f_p. <nEwLiNe>So, f_p = 3f_p + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that gives f_p = 3f_p + 3 => -2f_p = 3 => f_p = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems messy, but let's proceed. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = homogeneous + particular = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, f(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>f(2) = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>f(3) = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>f(4) = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>f(5) = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=6: <nEwLiNe>f(6) = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=7: <nEwLiNe>f(7) = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=8: <nEwLiNe>f(8) = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=9: <nEwLiNe>f(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=10: <nEwLiNe>f(10) = (11*59049 - 9)/6 = (649539 - 9)/6 = 649530/6 = 108255 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, the formula works. So, for n=10, f(10) = 108,255. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the correct answer. To make sure, I can also compute the expression step by step manually, although it's time-consuming. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of the expression as a geometric series. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is f(n) = 3f(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This can be rewritten as f(n) + 1 = 3f(n-1) + 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, let me try to write f(n) in terms of f(n-1): <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3 + 3f(n-1) <nEwLiNe>Let me define g(n) = f(n) + c, where c is a constant to be determined such that g(n) satisfies a homogeneous recurrence. <nEwLiNe>So, g(n) = f(n) + c = 3 + 3f(n-1) + c = 3 + 3(f(n-1) + c - c) + c = 3 + 3(g(n-1) - c) + c = 3 + 3g(n-1) - 3c + c = 3 + 3g(n-1) - 2c. <nEwLiNe>We want g(n) = 3g(n-1). So, set 3 + 3g(n-1) - 2c = 3g(n-1). Therefore, 3 - 2c = 0 => c = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, define g(n) = f(n) + 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Then, g(n) = 3g(n-1). <nEwLiNe>With g(1) = f(1) + 3/2 = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 = 11/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, g(n) = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Thus, f(n) = g(n) - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>f(2) = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>f(3) = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>f(4) = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>f(5) = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=6: <nEwLiNe>f(6) = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=7: <nEwLiNe>f(7) = (11*729 - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=8: <nEwLiNe>f(8) = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=9: <nEwLiNe>f(9) = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=10: <nEwLiNe>f(10) = (11*19683 - 3)/2 = (216513 - 3)/2 = 216510/2 = 108255 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, this formula also gives the correct result. So, f(n) = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=10, f(10) = (11*3^9 - 3)/2 = (11*19683 - 3)/2 = (216513 - 3)/2 = 216510/2 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods confirm that the value is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 and see if that relates. <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049. <nEwLiNe>But in our formula, we have 3^{n-1}, so for n=10, it's 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so f(10) = (11*19683 - 3)/2 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers, I get 108,255. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid.

 Okay, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how to tackle this. It looks like a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that involve 1 plus some multiple of 3. Maybe I can work from the inside out since each expression is nested inside the previous one.  <nEwLiNe>Let me start by identifying the innermost part. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me make sure. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). So, replacing that, we get: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving one layer out, now the next innermost is (1 + 3(...)), but now the innermost is 4. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(something). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>So, the second innermost is 1 + 3*(4). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should number the layers. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. But the original expression is 3 times (Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000; 9000*3=27000; 500*3=1500; 20*3=60; 4*3=12. So adding those together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 * 2 = 6 + 1 = 7 <nEwLiNe>3 * 5 = 15, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 * 9 = 27 +1 = 28, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 * 2 = 6 + 2 = 8 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29,524 * 3 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 *3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my layers because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing each layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me go back step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3:1 +3*13=1+39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4:1 +3*40=1+120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5:1 +3*121=1+363=364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3 * 29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct.

Hmm. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to approach this. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, notice that each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer can be represented recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote L(n) as the value of the nth layer, starting from L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, we have a recurrence relation: L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>We can find A and B using the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Given L(1)=4, so: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + B => 4 = 3A + B <nEwLiNe>Also, for n=0, if we consider L(0)=1 (since if n=0, it would be the innermost 1), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can compute the homogeneous and particular solutions. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L(n) - 3*L(n-1) = 1. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is L_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_p(n) = D. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>D - 3*D =1 => -2D=1 => D= -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is L(n)=C*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition L(1)=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, L(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, L(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify with n=1: L(1)= (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: L(2)= (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 is L(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, L(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L(9)=3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the final result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is similar to a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>But since we've already got the recurrence solved, and the formula gives us 88,572, I think that's solid. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out a way to simplify this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up with multiple layers of 1 + 3 multiplied by something. It's like a repeated pattern. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. Let me write that down. <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result is 4, it would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so the next layer is 13. <nEwLiNe>Let me keep track: <nEwLiNe>1st layer (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2nd layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*13 is 39, then 1 + 39 is 40. So, the third layer is 40. <nEwLiNe>3rd layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>Calculating: 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>4th layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>5th layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>3*364: Let's calculate that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>6th layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>7th layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding up: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>8th layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding all together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>9th layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression has nine layers, right? Let me check: starting from the innermost as layer 1, each time we go out, it's another layer. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time multiplied by 3 and added 1. So, I think I have 9 layers here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, how many layers? Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous).

So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each time a new layer is added. So, how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: Each (1 + 3( starts a new layer. Let's count them. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, the number of (1 + 3(...) is 9? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>5.

(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3, then each (1 + 3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of (1 + 3( in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the first (1 + 3( is after the first 3, then each subsequent (1 + 3( is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does (1 + 3( appear?

So, the number of times we have (1 + 3( is 8? Because the innermost is just 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another (1 + 3(. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think differently. Each time we have a (1 + 3(...)), which is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each time we go out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, since starting from 1 + 3, and each time wrapping another layer. <nEwLiNe>But actually, when we have the expression 3(1 + 3(...)), the innermost is 1 + 3, and each time we have a new (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, it's layer 1: 1 + 3, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3:1 + 3*(layer2), etc., up to layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, we have 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from layer1=4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, earlier when I was computing, I got up to layer9=29524, but then the entire expression is 3*(layer9). So, the final result is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let me make sure: starting from layer1=4, then layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9)=3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let's compute that step by step. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculations. <nEwLiNe>Starting from layer1=4 <nEwLiNe>layer2=1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>layer3=1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>layer4=1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>layer5=1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>layer6=1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>layer7=1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>layer8=1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>layer9=1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so is that the final answer? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the multiplications or additions. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer: <nEwLiNe>layer1=1+3=4 <nEwLiNe>layer2=1 + 3*4=1 + 12=13 <nEwLiNe>layer3=1 + 3*13=1 + 39=40 <nEwLiNe>layer4=1 + 3*40=1 + 120=121 <nEwLiNe>layer5=1 + 3*121=1 + 363=364 <nEwLiNe>layer6=1 + 3*364=1 + 1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>layer7=1 + 3*1093=1 + 3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>layer8=1 + 3*3280=1 + 9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>layer9=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3 again: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>= 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like each level is 3 times something, and inside each something, it's 1 plus another similar expression. So, maybe I can approach this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, I'll rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis is another layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>It seems like there are 9 layers of parentheses. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, if I can compute each layer starting from the inside, I can build up the result step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost and L9 is the outermost. Then, each layer is defined as: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 <nEwLiNe>And then, the entire expression is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>So, I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me start with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that was simple. Now, moving to L2: <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Great, now L3: <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's 40. L4: <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 121? Hmm, seems like the numbers are growing quickly. Let me check that again. L3 was 40, so 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to L5: <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Whoa, 364. Okay, L6: <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>1093? That's a big number. Let me verify: 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Now, L7: <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>3280. Hmm, okay. L8: <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Wow, 9841. And finally, L9: <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, L9 is 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*L9, so: <nEwLiNe>Result = 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 3*29524. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*20 = 60 <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any layer. Let me go through each L again: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1+3=4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L2:1+3*4=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L3:1+3*13=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L4:1+3*40=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L5:1+3*121=364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L6:1+3*364=1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L7:1+3*1093=3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L8:1+3*3280=9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L9:1+3*9841=29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's correct. Each step seems to follow logically, and I double-checked each multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think about this as a geometric series or something, but since each term is built on the previous one with a factor of 3, it's a linear recurrence. But since the numbers get big quickly, I think computing each step manually is the safest way. <nEwLiNe>Just to get another perspective, maybe I can write the expression in terms of powers of 3 or something. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 => L_p - 3*L_p = 1 => -2*L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition L1=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: L1=(3^2 -1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=2: L2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that formula works! So, L9=29524, as I computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since L_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then 3*L9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*(59048)/2 = (3*59048)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 59048/2=29524, then 29524*3=88572, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms that the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think this is solid. I used two different methods: step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation, both leading to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. Let me write it down to see it clearly: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like each layer is 1 plus 3 times another layer. Maybe I can work from the inside out. Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 1 + 3( result from step 1 ) <nEwLiNe>3. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds one more layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, there are 9 layers inside. So, I need to compute starting from the innermost and work my way outwards. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each step by step. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so L9 is the outermost layer inside the big expression. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 29524 * 3. Let me do this multiplication step by step. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check each step because sometimes when working through multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364.

Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be extra cautious, let me compute 29524 * 3 another way. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x     3 <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit: <nEwLiNe>4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. Same as before. So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of 29524 as 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20,000 *3=60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000*3=27,000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1,500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now add them all: <nEwLiNe>60,000 +27,000=87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 +1,500=88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 +60=88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 +12=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure that I didn't miscalculate any of the layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from L1 to L9: <nEwLiNe>L1: 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems correct. So, the final computation is 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to see if there's a pattern here, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*previous_layer. So, it's a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each term is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me think about it. Suppose we have a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, which can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>To find C, set a_n = C, then C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C =1 => C= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition, when n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our case, how many layers do we have? Starting from L1 to L9, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think this is solid. I've computed it step by step, then also derived a formula for the nth term, which gives the same result. So, confident that 88,572 is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Let me write it down again to see the structure better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, it seems like there are nine layers of parentheses.

Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then the next one: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then the next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each expression starting from the innermost as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E9 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is the last one: (1 + 3). Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>First innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward: 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>So let me write it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Step 7: Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Step 8: Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Step 9: Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3: 3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let me check how many steps I did. Each step is one layer, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So starting from (1 + 3) = 4, that's one step. Then each subsequent step adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, if I have nine layers, I should have nine steps. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's nine steps, each corresponding to a layer. So the result inside the outermost parentheses is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that. <nEwLiNe>So 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me do it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So reading the numbers from top: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait. Let me write it properly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 is: <nEwLiNe>Digits: 2 9 5 2 4 <nEwLiNe>Multiply each by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15. Write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524 = 59048 <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So the total expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me confirm each step because sometimes when you do a lot of steps, it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So the innermost parentheses result in 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is 29524 * 3 equal to 88572? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 + 12 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can write it as 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the earlier steps, let me recompute some of the layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Yes, all these steps seem correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing all the layers, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524, and multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. I need to figure out a way to simplify this step by step. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested expressions where each one is of the form \(1 + 3(...)\). It seems like each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward? That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is \(1 + 3\). <nEwLiNe>2. Then the next layer is \(1 + 3(1 + 3)\). <nEwLiNe>3. Then \(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\). <nEwLiNe>4. And this continues, adding a layer each time. <nEwLiNe>Wait, how many layers are there exactly? Let me count the opening parentheses. Each time, the expression is \(1 + 3(...)\). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>- First: \(1 + 3\) <nEwLiNe>- Then: \(1 + 3(1 + 3)\) <nEwLiNe>- Next: \(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))\) <nEwLiNe>- Then: \(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))\) <nEwLiNe>- Continuing: \(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))\) <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times we have a \(1 + 3(...)\) structure. Each time, we add another layer. Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>It's \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost \(1 + 3\), each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. How many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me see: The innermost is layer 1: \(1 + 3\). Then layer 2: \(1 + 3(\text{layer 1})\). Layer 3: \(1 + 3(\text{layer 2})\), and so on until layer 9, because each time we add a layer, and the original expression has 9 layers of \(1 + 3(...)\) inside the outermost 3(...). Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the expression, starting after the first 3, there are nine instances of \(1 + 3(...)\), each nested within the previous. So, starting from the innermost, that's 9 layers. So, 9 layers in total, each time \(1 + 3(...)\). <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I can compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost and working my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as \(a_n\), where \(n\) is the layer number, starting from 1 as the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, layer 1: \(a_1 = 1 + 3\). <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1\). <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2\). <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to layer 9: \(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8\). <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is \(3a_9\). <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute \(a_1\) through \(a_9\), and then multiply by 3, that should give me the result. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each \(a_n\) step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with \(a_1\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>Then, \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>Next, \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>Then, \(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Then, \(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3*121\). Let's compute that: 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, \(a_5 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>Proceeding to \(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3*364\). 3*364 is... let me compute 364*3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900+180=1080, 1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. So, \(a_6 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>Next, \(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3*1093\). Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000+270=3270, 3270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. So, \(a_7 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>Moving on to \(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3*3280\). Let's compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Therefore, \(a_8 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, \(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3*9841\). Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. So, \(a_9 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 times \(a_9\), so we need to compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524*3. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an error in any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with \(a_1\) through \(a_9\): <nEwLiNe>- \(a_1 = 4\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524\) (correct) <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each \(a_n\) seems to be following a recurrence relation: \(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). This is a linear recurrence, so perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for \(a_n\). <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is \(a_n = A \cdot 3^{n} + B\), where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>Given \(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\), with \(a_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: \(a_n^{(h)} = C \cdot 3^n\). <nEwLiNe>Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution \(a_n^{(p)} = K\). <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>\(K = 3K + 1\) <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>\(K - 3K = 1\) <nEwLiNe>\(-2K = 1\) <nEwLiNe>\(K = -1/2\) <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = C \cdot 3^n - 1/2\) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>When n=1, \(a_1 = 4\): <nEwLiNe>\(4 = C \cdot 3^1 - 1/2\) <nEwLiNe>\(4 = 3C - 1/2\) <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>\(4 + 1/2 = 3C\) <nEwLiNe>\(9/2 = 3C\) <nEwLiNe>So, \(C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form formula is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = (3/2) \cdot 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\) <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>\(a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>\(a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>\(a_3 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>\(a_4 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>\(a_5=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: <nEwLiNe>\(a_6=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: <nEwLiNe>\(a_7=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: <nEwLiNe>\(a_8=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: <nEwLiNe>\(a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524\) Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. Therefore, \(a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 =29524\). Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9= 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is \(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + \dots ))\), which is similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, since it's nested, each term is 1 plus 3 times the next term, so it's a bit different. <nEwLiNe>But since I've already found a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, which gives me confidence that the result is 88572, I think that's solid. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3*a_9 again: <nEwLiNe>29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 8 8 5 7 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I'm confident the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Alright, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together in a recursive way. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer: <nEwLiNe>3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, there are nine sets of parentheses, each containing 1 + 3 times something.

It's easy to slip up with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3.

Let me think about it. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost.

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so now I can replace that innermost part with 4.  <nEwLiNe>So moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.  <nEwLiNe>First, compute the multiplication: 3 * 4 is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13.  <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving another layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(13). Let me calculate that.  <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. So, now that layer is 40.  <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3(40).  <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120. Adding 1 gives 121.  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(121).  <nEwLiNe>3 times 121 is 363. Adding 1, that's 364.  <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3(364).  <nEwLiNe>3 multiplied by 364 is... let me calculate that. 364 times 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 3*364=1092. Then, adding 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(1093).  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 3 times 1093. Let me compute that: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, adding 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280).  <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280. Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, adding those together: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next expression is 1 + 3(9841).  <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, adding 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next, the outermost layer is 1 + 3(29524).  <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, add 1: 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that result: 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*88573. Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>80000*3=240000 <nEwLiNe>8000*3=24000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>70*3=210 <nEwLiNe>3*3=9 <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that addition: <nEwLiNe>240000 + 24000 = 264000 <nEwLiNe>264000 + 1500 = 265500 <nEwLiNe>265500 + 210 = 265710 <nEwLiNe>265710 + 9 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct.  <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except for the very last step where we just multiplied by 3.  <nEwLiNe>Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>Each step seems to follow logically.

Wait, no, actually, let me clarify. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse this correctly. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something).

Yes, that seems right. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula here that can make this easier, instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer, it seems like each time, we're doing 1 + 3*previous layer. So, if I denote each layer as L_n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation.

Since the recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 1, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is L_n = 3*L_{n-1}, which has the solution L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition to find C. When n=1, L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: L_n = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: L1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, since we have 9 layers, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is L9. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since L9 = (3^{10} -1)/2, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 3*(59049 -1)/2 = 3*59048/2 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, we get the same answer. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. So, I can confidently say the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all the nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so yes, replacing that with 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3(4). Hmm, let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, compute 3 times 4, which is 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 equals 13. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. So, originally, after the first replacement, the innermost was 1 + 3(4). So, replacing that with 13, now the next layer is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I skipped a step. Let me retrace. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Then: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Then: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Then: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: 3*(result from step 9) = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. So, starting from the innermost, each time we replace the innermost expression with the result and compute the next layer. There are 9 sets of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, we have to compute 9 layers? Wait, let me count the number of (1+3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is the 9th (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>- Then each layer outwards is another (1 + 3*(...)), so we have 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I started computing, I thought that after computing the innermost, each step goes out one layer, so 9 steps in total. But when I did the first step, replacing (1 + 3) with 4, then the next step was replacing (1 + 3*4) with 13, then (1 + 3*13) with 40, and so on. So, each step corresponds to one layer. <nEwLiNe>So, if I have 9 layers, that would mean I have 9 computations. Let me list them step by step. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this result1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. result2 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. result3 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. result4 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. result5 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. result6 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. result7 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. result8 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. result9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we have result9 = 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(result9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*29524. Let's do this step by step. <nEwLiNe>29524 multiplied by 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3 = 27. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524   <nEwLiNe>x    3   <nEwLiNe>-------   <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15 +2=17, write 7, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from bottom: 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let's do it properly: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>- Units place: 4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>- Tens place: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>- Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>- Thousands place: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>- Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>- Hundred-thousands place: 9*3=27, write 27? Wait, no, 29524 is a 5-digit number: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). So, when multiplying by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12: write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7: write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15: write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28: write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8: write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing from the bottom up: 8 (from 2*3+2), 8 (from 9*3+1), 5 (from 5*3), 7 (from 2*3+1), 2 (from 4*3). So, the number is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the earlier steps, let me go through the results again: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40=1 +120=121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121=1 +363=364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364=1 +1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093=1 +3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280=1 +9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 1. So, it's like a geometric progression, but with each term being 3 times the previous plus 1. Hmm, actually, that might be a way to model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Let’s denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. Then, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 =1 + 3*a_2=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, this is a linear recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>This kind of recurrence can be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r -3=0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier result. So, that's a good check. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like each level is multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside another set of parentheses. Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let's identify the innermost part. The expression starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost part is the last one: 1 + 3. That should be easy. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that gives me 13. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(13). Let's calculate that: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 40. I see a pattern here where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Let me keep going: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, the next layer would be 1 + 3*121. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3*121 is 363? Let me double-check: 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363, yeah that's right. So 364. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364. Let's see, 3*300 is 900, 3*64 is 192, so 900 + 192 is 1092. Then add 1: 1093. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 1093. Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093 first. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*93 is 279, so total is 3000 + 279 = 3279. Then add 1: 3280. <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving on. Next layer is 1 + 3*3280. Let's calculate 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Add 1: 9841. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 9841. That seems familiar. Wait, 9841 is 99^2, right? 99*99 is 9801, no, wait, 99*99 is 9801, 100*100 is 10000, so 9841 must be 99.2 or something? Wait, no, 99^2 is 9801, 100^2 is 10000, so 9841 is in between. Maybe it's a perfect square? Let me check: 99^2 is 9801, 9841 is 99.2^2? Wait, 99^2 is 9801, 99*99 is 9801, 99*100 is 9900, so 9841 is 99.2? No, that's not exact. Wait, actually, 9841 is 99^2 + 40. Hmm, maybe it's a different square? Let me see: 98^2 is 9604, 99^2 is 9801, 100^2 is 10000. So 9841 is not a perfect square. Maybe I was mistaken. Let me move on. <nEwLiNe>So, next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*41 is 123. So, 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then add 1: 29524. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so 29524. Next layer is 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. So, 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then add 1: 88573. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so 88573. Next layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*73 is 219. So, 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 219 is 265719. Then add 1: 265720. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 265720. Is that right? Let me verify: 88573*3 is indeed 265,719, plus 1 is 265,720. Yep. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving to the outermost layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let's compute 3*265720. 3*200000 is 600,000, 3*60,000 is 180,000, 3*5,000 is 15,000, 3*720 is 2,160. So, adding up: 600,000 + 180,000 is 780,000, plus 15,000 is 795,000, plus 2,160 is 797,160. Then add 1: 797,161. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final result is 797,161? Let me just go through each step once more to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 1 + 88,572 = 88,573 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 3*88,573 = 1 + 265,719 = 265,720 <nEwLiNe>12. 1 + 3*265,720 = 1 + 797,160 = 797,161 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I just realized I miscounted the layers. Let me see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3(1 + ... starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 3*88,573 = 265,720 <nEwLiNe>12. 1 + 3*265,720 = 797,161 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the original expression is 3 times the outermost parentheses, which is 797,161. But wait, hold on: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so the outermost is 3*(result of the inner expression). So, did I compute that correctly? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in my initial computation, I thought the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds a 3*(previous) +1. But in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, when I was computing, I did each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Wait, maybe I misapplied the operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, perhaps I was incorrect before. Let me try to represent this properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as E1, then E2, E3, etc., up to E9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's count the number of 3(1 + ...). The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then E2 = 1 + 3*E1 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, I had miscounted earlier. I thought the outermost is 3*(...), but actually, the innermost is E1 = 1 + 3, then E2 = 1 + 3*E1, and so on, until E9, then the total expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>So, let me recast my computations: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that contradicts my previous result. So, in my initial computation, I went one layer further because I was considering the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer, but in reality, the expression is only 3*(E9), where E9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, this is conflicting with my previous computation where I thought I had 797,161. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>It is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 is E1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(E1) = E2 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>Then, E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>So, E9 is 29,524, which is the innermost part of the outermost 3*(...). So, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so my initial computation was wrong because I thought the outermost 3*(...) was another layer beyond E9, but actually, E9 is the innermost part of the outermost 3*(...). So, the total expression is just 3*E9, which is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my first approach, I thought that each layer was 1 + 3*(previous), starting from the innermost, and I went all the way up, which gave me 797,161, but that was incorrect because I was treating the outermost 3*(...) as an additional layer beyond E9, which it's not. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is built by 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, E1 through E9 are each 1 + 3*(previous), and then the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the correct result should be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But now, I'm confused because in my first approach, I treated the entire expression as 12 layers, but now, upon correct parsing, it's only 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3*(...) in the original expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each 3*(...) is one layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to parse this more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(1,093) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(3,280) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(9,841) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, the innermost is 4, and each layer adds 1 + 3*(previous), for a total of 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(result of the 9th layer), which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I had 12 layers because I thought the outermost 3*(...) was another layer, but now, upon closer inspection, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part is 9 layers deep. So, the total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 9, and the outermost is just 3*(E9). <nEwLiNe>So, the confusion arises from how I count the layers. So, to be precise, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(E9), where E9 is 1 + 3*E8 <nEwLiNe>And E8 is 1 + 3*E7, etc., down to E1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute E1 through E9: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 =40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 =121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 =364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1,092 =1,093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3,279 =3,280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9,840 =9,841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29,523 =29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression = 3*E9 = 3*29,524 =88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I thought I was going through 12 layers, I got 797,161, which is incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the key is to recognize that the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is built from 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct computation leads to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute E1 to E9 step by step again: <nEwLiNe>E1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>E3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 =40 <nEwLiNe>E4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 =121 <nEwLiNe>E5: 1 + 3*121 =1 + 363 =364 <nEwLiNe>E6: 1 + 3*364 =1 + 1,092 =1,093 <nEwLiNe>E7: 1 + 3*1,093 =1 + 3,279 =3,280 <nEwLiNe>E8: 1 + 3*3,280 =1 + 9,840 =9,841 <nEwLiNe>E9: 1 + 3*9,841 =1 + 29,523 =29,524 <nEwLiNe>Total expression: 3*29,524 =88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute E9 and the total expression numerically: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>E3 =1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>E4=1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>E5=1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>E6=1 + 3*364=1,093 <nEwLiNe>E7=1 + 3*1,093=3,280 <nEwLiNe>E8=1 + 3*3,280=9,841 <nEwLiNe>E9=1 + 3*9,841=29,524 <nEwLiNe>Total=3*29,524=88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, my initial mistake was treating the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, but it's actually just multiplying the 9th layer by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29,524: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 *3 =60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000*3=27,000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1,500 <nEwLiNe>24*3=72 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60,000 +27,000=87,000; 87,000 +1,500=88,500; 88,500 +72=88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on, in my initial approach, I computed 12 layers and got 797,161, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. So, the key takeaway is that the expression is 3*(E9), where E9 is built from 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous), which results in 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make absolutely sure, let me compute the expression step by step, starting from the innermost and moving outwards, ensuring that I don't miscount the layers. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 =4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*364=1,093 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*1,093=3,280 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*3,280=9,841 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 + 3*9,841=29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29,524=88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me check with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions. <nEwLiNe>This expression resembles a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as a1 =1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, a2 =1 + 3*a1 <nEwLiNe>a3 =1 + 3*a2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a9 =1 + 3*a8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_{n} =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^{n} + C <nEwLiNe>We can find C by solving the equation: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Which gives C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems odd, but let's proceed. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a1=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form expression is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^10=59,049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (59,049 -1)/2 =59,048/2=29,524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9=3*29,524=88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms that the answer is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after careful consideration and verifying through multiple methods, I conclude that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
20,88572,1,8,2685,"
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all the nested parentheses. But I think I can break it down step by step. Let me see... It's like a chain of 1s and 3s, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out in a way that shows the nesting: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that might not be the correct substitution. Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Actually, the innermost is the last (1 + 3). So, let's number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost as layers 1 through 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(result of Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(result of Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me verify if I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, right? Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and moving outward. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me write down the layers more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, computing 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72, carryover 7 <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72 + 7 = 79, carryover 7 <nEwLiNe>52 * 3 = 156 + 7 = 163, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>95 * 3 = 285 + 1 = 286, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>29 * 3 = 87 + 2 = 89 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me do it properly: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write 7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>Now, the last digit is 2 (from 29524) which is 2*3=6 + carryover 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait. 29524 is five digits: 2,9,5,2,4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's write it down: <nEwLiNe>     2 9 5 2 4 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>------------ <nEwLiNe>Starting from the units place: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8 <nEwLiNe>So the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my layers because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to make a mistake in substitution. <nEwLiNe>Let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such expressions? It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our problem, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's consistent with what I got earlier. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have used the formula directly without computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>But since I was able to compute each layer manually and verify with the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"
