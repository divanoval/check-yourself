Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.

 Looking at the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, right? Let me confirm: starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer wraps that result in another 3*(1 + ...). So, let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a term. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as term 1, then term 2, up to term 9, since there are 9 layers of 3(...). Hmm, wait, let me count the number of 3s. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until the outermost 3(...). So, actually, there are 9 layers here because each time we add another 3(1 + ...). Let me make sure: starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48, and so on. So, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I define a recurrence relation, where each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on until we have 9 layers. So, term1 = 4, term2 = 15, term3 = 48, term4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147, term5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444, term6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335, term7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008, term8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027, term9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me check that. Because each layer is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then the next is 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Next, 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Then 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Then 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Next, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Then 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084.  <nEwLiNe>So, if I follow this correctly, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1,335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1,335) = 3*1,336 = 4,008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4,008) = 3*4,009 = 12,027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Okay, each step seems correct. Let me check the arithmetic: <nEwLiNe>- 3*5 is 15, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*16 is 48, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*49 is 147, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*148: 148*3. 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; 300+120=420+24=444, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*445: 400*3=1,200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; 1,200+120=1,320+15=1,335, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*1,336: 1,000*3=3,000; 300*3=900; 30*3=90; 6*3=18; adding them: 3,000 + 900 = 3,900; 3,900 + 90 = 3,990; 3,990 + 18 = 4,008, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*4,009: 4,000*3=12,000; 9*3=27; 12,000 +27=12,027, correct. <nEwLiNe>- 3*12,028: 12,000*3=36,000; 28*3=84; 36,000 +84=36,084, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step adds up correctly. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward, writing each step as I go. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute 1 + 3: That's 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Now, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 4). So, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 6). So, 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 8). So, 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 9). So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's a different result. So, now I'm confused because earlier I got 36,084, but now following this step-by-step, I get 88,572. There must be a mistake in my approach. Let me figure out where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the first approach, I considered the innermost as 1 + 3 = 4, then each subsequent layer as 3*(1 + previous term). But in the second approach, I started from the innermost and each time computed 1 + 3*(previous result). So, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the first approach, starting from the innermost, I thought of each layer as 3*(1 + previous term). But in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, if I denote each term as starting from the innermost, then: <nEwLiNe>Let me try to reindex. Let me think of the innermost as term1, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then term2 is 3*(1 + term1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>term3 is 3*(1 + term2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>term4 is 3*(1 + term3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>term5 is 3*(1 + term4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>term6 is 3*(1 + term5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1,335. <nEwLiNe>term7 is 3*(1 + term6) = 3*(1 + 1,335) = 4,008. <nEwLiNe>term8 is 3*(1 + term7) = 3*(1 + 4,008) = 12,027. <nEwLiNe>term9 is 3*(1 + term8) = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I started computing 1 + 3*(previous result) each time, which led me to 88,572. But that seems inconsistent. Wait, perhaps I miscounted how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, how many 3s are there? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, each parenthesis introduces another 3*(1 + ...). So, the original expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1+3, so that's one 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer adds another 3(...). So, from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Then the outermost 3*(Layer9). So, in total, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, total layers inside are 9, and then the outermost 3*(...). So, that's 10 layers? Wait, no. Wait, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in total, we have 9 layers inside, each of the form 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3. So, total of 10 operations? Not sure, but the important thing is that each time, starting from Layer1 to Layer9, each is 1 + 3*(previous Layer), and then the final result is 3*(Layer9). <nEwLiNe>So, in my first approach, I computed Layer1 to Layer9 correctly, getting 36,084. But in the second approach, I was starting from the innermost and moving outward, but perhaps I didn't account for the outermost 3 correctly. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my second approach, I started from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this approach, I have 10 steps: 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*(...). So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the innermost is Layer1 or Layer0. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from 1 + 3, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). So, in the first approach, I computed 9 layers, each as 3*(1 + previous), starting from 4, resulting in 36,084. But in the second approach, I computed 9 layers of 1 + 3*(previous), starting from 4, leading to 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which one is correct? Let's parse the original expression carefully. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1,335 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 1,335) = 4,008 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 4,008) = 12,027 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from 4, resulting in 36,084. Therefore, the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I started with 1 + 3*4 = 13, which is different. So, why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps in the second approach, I misapplied the operations. Let me see: in the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the previous result). So, starting with 4, then 3*(1 + 4), then 3*(1 + 15), etc., up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I was starting with 1 + 3*4, which is different because that would be adding 1 to 3*4, but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, I think the confusion is that in the second approach, I incorrectly added 1 to 3*(previous) instead of computing 3*(1 + previous). So, in the second approach, I mistakenly thought that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, that's where the mistake was. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, each layer is 3*(1 + the result of the inner expression). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1,335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1,335) = 4,008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4,008) = 12,027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + previous). Therefore, the total expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I incorrectly computed each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), which led to a different result. So, that was my mistake. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous), not 1 + 3*(previous). So, the correct result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step, layer by layer, making sure I follow the correct order. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1,335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1,335) = 3*1,336 = 4,008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4,008) = 3*4,009 = 12,027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we reach 36,084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check the original expression again to make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3, that's one 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, we have: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3(1 + ...). So, each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers do we have? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s inside the parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) - first 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the number of 3s is 9, because starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, in total, from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from 4, leading to 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to cross-verify, let me compute the expression using a different approach. Maybe I can represent this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But since the expression is finite, with 9 layers, it's not an infinite series, so I can't directly apply the formula for an infinite geometric series. However, perhaps I can express it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me define E_n as the value of the expression with n layers. So, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but wait, no. Wait, E_1 would be the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 15, E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we can compute E_n using this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given that, let's compute E_1 to E_9: <nEwLiNe>E_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>E_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>E_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>E_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1,335 <nEwLiNe>E_7 = 3*(1 + 1,335) = 4,008 <nEwLiNe>E_8 = 3*(1 + 4,008) = 12,027 <nEwLiNe>E_9 = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the earlier computation. Therefore, E_9 = 36,084, which is the value of the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for E_n. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence as E_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: K - 3*K = 3 => -2*K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = E_n^{(h)} + E_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1.5 => 3*C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as E_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>E_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>n=2: E_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1,335, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4,008, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12,027, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. Therefore, E_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. For n=9, E_9 = (11*19,683 - 9)/6 = (216,513 - 9)/6 = 216,504/6 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute E_9 using the formula: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2,187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19,683 = Let's compute 10*19,683 = 196,830; 1*19,683 = 19,683; so total is 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) equals 4. Okay, so that innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 3 multiplied by that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, no, hold on. Let me look again. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each time, it's 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving one step out, it's 3*(1 + 4).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure. So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous result)). Hmm, no, actually, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe it's 3*(1 + (inner result)). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., from the innermost to the outermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let's count the number of 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(...)). Each time, it's 3 multiplied by another (1 + 3(...)). So, how many 3(...) sections are there? Let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So, let's count: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: (1 + 3) is L1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each 3(1 + ...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers. But actually, each layer is the 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1. Then, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has 9 layers? Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Each ""3("" adds a new layer, starting from the innermost. So, how many ""3("" are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>So, yes, there are 9 layers. Therefore, the computation goes up to Layer 9. So, as I computed above, Layer 9 is 36084. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. <nEwLiNe>Let me go step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36084. But wait, let me verify this another way to make sure. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let's denote the nth term as a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given that, we have: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>But actually, wait, a_1 is the innermost, so maybe a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so it's a geometric progression? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each term is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2C = 3 <nEwLiNe>C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to 8/2: <nEwLiNe>8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 <nEwLiNe>And 3/2 is just 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Now, since we need a_9, let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Now, plug into a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 10*19683 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>Then, add 19683: 196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504 <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36000 = 216000 <nEwLiNe>216504 - 216000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me check my calculations again. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 for n=9. <nEwLiNe>3^9 is indeed 19683. <nEwLiNe>11*19683: 10*19683=196830, plus 1*19683=19683, total 216513. <nEwLiNe>216513 - 9 = 216504. <nEwLiNe>216504 / 6: 6*36000=216000, remainder 504. <nEwLiNe>504 /6=84. <nEwLiNe>So, total 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since I computed it step by step earlier, and both methods gave me the same result, I'm confident that 36084 is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is $\boxed{36084}"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 3 is 4. That simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Hmm, 3 * 4 is 12. Okay, so that simplifies the next layer to 12.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, actually, after simplifying the innermost part, the next layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let me make sure I'm tracking this correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step methodically. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is L2: 1 + 3*(result of L1). Wait, actually, no. Wait, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me number them from the inside out. Let's say the innermost is Layer 1, then Layer 2 wraps around it, and so on until Layer 9, since I count nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let's see: starting from the left, 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, each time, it's 3 times (1 + ...). How many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3s: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, I see 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)) nine times? Wait, no, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe a better approach is to count how many times ""1 + 3("" appears. Let's see:  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of times the pattern ""1 + 3("" occurs.

Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers?

So, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with nine layers inside. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost inside the first 3*. So, yes, the total expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524.

Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C = 1 + 3C => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Let me clarify: in our earlier counting, Layer 1 corresponds to n=1, which is (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Layer 2 would be (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which also matches. So, yes, the formula seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem without computing each layer, but recognizing the pattern. <nEwLiNe>Given that each layer is 1 + 3*previous layer, and there are 9 layers, it's essentially a geometric series with a factor of 3 each time, but with an added 1 each layer. <nEwLiNe>But since we derived the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and verified it with both manual computation and the recurrence relation, I feel confident that the result is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is $\boxed{88572}"

 Looking at the expression, I see multiple layers of 1 + 3(...). The innermost one is 1 + 3, right? So, starting from there: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that. Each time, the innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is 4. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I can think of this as a repeated process where each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me try to write it out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>- Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. So, from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, yes, 9 layers, each time building on the previous one. So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. Then, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, after Layer 9 is 29524, then the final result is 3*29524, which is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each step just to be sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere. It's easy to slip up with large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Hmm, 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12; so 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279; so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840; so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. So, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 24*3=72. So, adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the result 88572. I think that's solid. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula instead of computing each step manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>I recall that such recurrence relations can be solved using the method for linear non-homogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 1 <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*C = 1 <nEwLiNe>C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our case, the layers go from 1 to 9, right? So, a_1=4, a_2=13, etc., up to a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Let's test the formula for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. So, the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^10=59049. Therefore, a_9=(59049 - 1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, both by iterative computation and by solving the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572. I feel confident that this is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me think about another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so expanding this, we can write: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2*(1 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3*a_{n-3} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, we can see that after expanding n times, we get: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0 <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our case, a_1=4, which is 1 + 3. So, actually, a_1 corresponds to n=1, which would be 1 + 3^1. So, perhaps the general formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, as we derived earlier. <nEwLiNe>Indeed, when n=1, a_1=(3^2 -1)/2=4, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula holds, and so a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both the iterative approach and the formula give the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: (1 + 3) = 4. Okay, so that part is simple enough. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 3 times that result. So, 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the layers. Each layer is 3*(1 + something). So actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4), right? Let me correct that. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. If I have 3*(1 + something), and the something is the next inner layer. So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, okay, that seems to be the pattern. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 3(1 + ... So, actually, there are 9 layers here. Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that can't be right because when I compute each layer, the numbers get huge very quickly. Let me verify this step by step, because I might have made an error in multiplication or addition. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so according to this, the final result is 36,084. But that seems quite large. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula to compute this without having to multiply each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to error. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is defined recursively. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. So, <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the same result as before. So, the final value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Each layer a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let's write it down: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is linear and can be expressed as: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is a_1 = 4, and the particular solution is -3/2, which is a fraction. Hmm, but our a_n are all integers. Maybe I made a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check the recurrence again. It's a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, the nonhomogeneous term is 3, so the particular solution should be a constant. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Assume a particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, same result. So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = 11*(3^{n}) / 6. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>a_n = 11*(3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for n=9, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9 first: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Total: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Now subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute this: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0 with remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>6 into 50 is 8 with remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>6 into 24 is 4. <nEwLiNe>6 into 0 is 0. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it step by step: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>- 6 into 2 is 0, but 6 into 21 is 3, write 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>- Bring down 6: 36. 6 into 36 is 6, write 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>- Bring down 5: 5. 6 into 5 is 0, write 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>- Bring down 0: 50. 6 into 50 is 8, write 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>- Bring down 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, write 4, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>- Bring down the last 0: 0. 6 into 0 is 0, write 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36,084. Which matches the earlier manual computation. So, that's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using the recurrence relation in another way, but since both methods gave me the same result, I feel confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. So, I think it's safe to conclude that the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me recheck a few steps: <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. 49*3 is 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27. 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. 12,028*3: 10,000*3=30,000, 2,000*3=6,000, 28*3=84. 30,000 + 6,000 = 36,000, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>All right, so after verifying each step, I'm confident that the computation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by expanding each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \( a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}) \). Starting with the innermost layer and working outward, each subsequent layer is calculated as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. \( (1 + 3) = 4 \) <nEwLiNe>2. \( 3(1 + 4) = 15 \) <nEwLiNe>3. \( 3(1 + 15) = 48 \) <nEwLiNe>4. \( 3(1 + 48) = 147 \) <nEwLiNe>5. \( 3(1 + 147) = 444 \) <nEwLiNe>6. \( 3(1 + 444) = 1335 \) <nEwLiNe>7. \( 3(1 + 1335) = 4008 \) <nEwLiNe>8. \( 3(1 + 4008) = 12027 \) <nEwLiNe>9. \( 3(1 + 12027) = 36084 \) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"
6,88572,1,16,5374,"
 Looking at the expression, I can see that the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). Wait, but since we've already computed 1 + 3 as 4, it's 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + the result of the second layer. So, it's 1 + 12. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3 times that. So, 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 39. <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*40. <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 120. <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3*121. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 363. <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Tenth layer: 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each set adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost, we have layers 1 through 9. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4: 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8: 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost operation is 3 times that result: 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with 9 layers inside. So, the innermost is layer 1, and then each subsequent layer is built upon the previous one. So, after layer 9, we have 1 + something, which is 364, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>So, let's correct that: <nEwLiNe>After layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me write down each layer clearly: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 1092. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*4 = 12 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*13 = 39 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*40 = 120 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*121 = 363 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*364 = 1092 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each step builds on the previous one, and the arithmetic checks out. So, the value of the expression is 1092. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think about it recursively. Let's denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's interesting. So, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let's verify this with the earlier values. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 =27-1=26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=243-1=242/2=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729-1=728/2=364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>In our original problem, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost layer before the final multiplication is layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 3^10 is 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. That contradicts my earlier calculation where I got a_9 =364. Hmm, something's wrong here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in my earlier step-by-step calculation, I had 9 layers, but in the formula, n=9 corresponds to a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2 =29524 <nEwLiNe>But in my manual calculation, I had a_9=364. That's a discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>So, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(... <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent ( adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the initial 3(. <nEwLiNe>There's 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, etc., until the innermost 1 + 3. So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer, and the innermost is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the total number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my step-by-step earlier, I had 9 layers, but according to the formula, a_9 would be 29524, but my manual computation gave me 364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me check again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the formula, a_n is defined as starting from n=1 being the innermost. So, in the original expression, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524 <nEwLiNe>But in my manual computation earlier, I only went up to layer 9 as 364, which was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think I confused the number of layers. Let's recount. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: 1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(4)=12; then 1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(13)=39; then 1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(40)=120; 1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(121)=363; 1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(364)=1092; 1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1093)=3279; 1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(3280)=9840; 1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(9841)=29523; 1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's different from my earlier result. So, I think I miscounted the layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the confusion is whether the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which would give a_9=29524, and then the final result is 3*a_9=88572 <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to 364, which was actually layer 5. <nEwLiNe>So, I think I need to clarify: how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of ""3("" after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of ""3("" after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 ""3("" after the initial 3. So, that would mean 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 1: 1 +3=4, and layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I only went up to layer 9 as 364, but that was incorrect because I was counting the layers incorrectly. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, each ""3("" adds a layer, and there are 9 of them. So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9. Therefore, the value before the final multiplication is a_9=29524, and the final result is 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this with the step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*4=12; 1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*13=39; 1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*40=120; 1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*121=363; 1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*364=1092; 1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*1093=3279; 1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*3280=9840; 1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*9841=29523; 1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, my initial mistake was miscounting the layers, thinking there were only 9 layers including the outermost multiplication, but actually, the outermost multiplication is separate from the 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check the formula. The formula gives a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2 for each layer n. So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think of the expression as starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 threes, then the value is 3*a_9, where a_9 is the result after 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let me compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3:4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Add 1:12+1=13 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:13*3=39 <nEwLiNe>Add1:39+1=40 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:40*3=120 <nEwLiNe>Add1:120+1=121 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:121*3=363 <nEwLiNe>Add1:363+1=364 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:364*3=1092 <nEwLiNe>Add1:1092+1=1093 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:1093*3=3279 <nEwLiNe>Add1:3279+1=3280 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:3280*3=9840 <nEwLiNe>Add1:9840+1=9841 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:9841*3=29523 <nEwLiNe>Add1:29523+1=29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by3:29524*3=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 18 steps, but each pair is a layer: 9 layers, each consisting of multiply by3 and add1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, each layer is 1 +3*(previous).

 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. So, let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3*(4) = 12. So, the next layer is 1 + 12. Let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me assign each layer a number from inside out, like layer 1, layer 2, up to layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Wait, let me count: starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so after computing layer 9, which is 29524, do I need to multiply that by 3? Let me check the structure. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, actually, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which means that after computing the innermost layers up to the ninth layer, that result is inside another 1 + 3*(...). Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, actually, the layers are as I computed: layer 1 is 4, layer 2 is 13, up to layer 9 is 29524. But then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of layers. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(4) = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(13) = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(40) = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(121) = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(364) = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1093) = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(3280) = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(9841) = 29523, then 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, layer 9 is 29524. But then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Wait, no, hold on. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, in my layering, layer 9 is the innermost, but actually, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(layer 9)). Wait, that can't be, because in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me think of the expression as a series of nested functions. Let me denote each nested part as f(n), where f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the innermost is f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to f(9). But the entire expression is 3*f(9). Wait, no. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that can't be, because if I do it that way, I'm not sure. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to define it differently. Let me consider each ""1 + 3(...)"" as a separate function. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems consistent with my earlier computation, where a_9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if I have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), then the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check the layers because sometimes it's easy to miscount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm the multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me try computing it step by step again. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>I notice that each term is 3*a_previous + 1, but wait, actually, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for a_9, it would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was to recognize the recursive structure, compute each layer step by step, and then apply the outermost multiplication by 3. Additionally, deriving the general formula for the nth term helped confirm that the result is consistent. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}."

 Looking at the expression, it seems that the innermost part is ""1 + 3"". Then, moving outward, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the next layer). So, if I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside, I can build up the solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this out step by step. Let's number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. So, layer 1 is the innermost, and layer 9 is the outermost. That makes sense because each time I see a ""1 + 3(...)"", that's a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting with layer 1: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 equals 4. <nEwLiNe>Moving to layer 2: 3 times (1 + the result of layer 1). So, that would be 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 is 5, and 3*5 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Now, layer 3: 3*(1 + the result of layer 2). So, 3*(1 + 15). 1 + 15 is 16, and 3*16 is 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48). 1 + 48 is 49, and 3*49 is 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147). 1 + 147 is 148, and 3*148 is 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444). 1 + 444 is 445, and 3*445 is 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335). 1 + 1335 is 1336, and 3*1336 is 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008). 1 + 4008 is 4009, and 3*4009 is 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027). 1 + 12027 is 12028, and 3*12028 is... let's see, 12028*3. Hmm, 12000*3 is 36000, and 28*3 is 84, so adding those together, 36000 + 84 is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me verify that computation because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. So, 12028 multiplied by 3. Breaking it down: 10000*3 is 30000, 2000*3 is 6000, 28*3 is 84. So adding those together: 30000 + 6000 is 36000, plus 84 is 36084. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, layer 9 gives us 36084. Since layer 9 is the outermost layer, that should be the result of the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any of the previous layers, let me recap: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at each step, the numbers seem to be increasing exponentially, which makes sense because each layer is multiplying by 3. It's a geometric progression, I think. So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote the value of the nth layer as a_n. Then, from the expression, we can see that: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Let's plug in the initial condition to find A and B. <nEwLiNe>When n = 1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B <nEwLiNe>We need another equation to solve for A and B. Let's consider the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Substituting the general solution into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3*(1 + A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right-hand side: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + A*3^{n-1} + B) = 3 + 3A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 3 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, B = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, using the initial condition: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 = 3A + B = 3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 3/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's compute a_9 using this formula. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>First, compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 is 19683. <nEwLiNe>Now, compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11 * 19683. Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, 10*19683 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1*19683 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*3^9 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504 <nEwLiNe>Then, divide by 6: 216504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down the 6: 36. 6 goes into 36 six times. <nEwLiNe>Bring down the 5: 5. 6 goes into 5 zero times, so write 0. Bring down the 0: 50. <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 50 eight times (8*6=48), remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down the 4: 24. 6 goes into 24 four times. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the same result as before! 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation and solving it with the closed-form formula, I still get 36,084. That gives me more confidence that my initial step-by-step computation was correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely thorough, let me recompute each layer one more time manually, just to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error in any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, all the intermediate results are the same as before. So, unless I made the same mistake twice in each layer, which is possible but unlikely, I think 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a geometric series or something else. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's like each term is 3 times (1 + the term before it). So, starting from 4, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's similar to a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, if I write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, that might be another way to look at it. Wait, no, in the expression, it's 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), which is 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous part is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has solution a_n = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3 <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, which is the same as earlier. So, yeah, that checks out. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2 = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2 = 216513/6 - 3/2 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. But wait, is this a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a series of multiplications and additions, but it's not a straightforward geometric series. However, perhaps I can express it in terms of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to expand the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on, that's not correct. Wait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), not 1 + 3*previous layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is what I had before. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as a continued multiplication and addition. Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) and so on. <nEwLiNe>But with nine layers, it's a bit too nested to write out directly. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as a sum of 3^k terms. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>If I expand the expression, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3 + 3*E1 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3 + 3*E2 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, writing out the terms: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the same result as before. So, this method also gives me 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a sum of 3^k terms. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence relation, En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This can be rewritten as En = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as before. <nEwLiNe>If I unroll the recurrence, perhaps I can express En in terms of a sum. <nEwLiNe>Let me try: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3 + 3*E2 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*4) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*4 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this pattern, each En adds another layer of 3. <nEwLiNe>So, for E9, it would be 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^9 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me write this more formally. <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence, En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This can be expanded as: <nEwLiNe>En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way until E1: <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n} * E1 <nEwLiNe>But E1 is 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, En = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n-1} * 4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check for n=2: <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Which matches 3 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=3: <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*4 = 3 + 9 + 36 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Which is correct. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, En = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k} + 3^{n} * E1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, when I expand En, it's 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n-1} * E1 <nEwLiNe>So, En = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k} + 3^{n} * E1 - 3^{n} ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not. Let's think about it. <nEwLiNe>Actually, En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*E_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*E_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>Continuing until E1, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, En = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n-1}*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, En = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k} + 3^{n} * 1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, because the last term is 3^{n-1}*(1 + 3) = 3^{n-1} + 3^{n} <nEwLiNe>So, En = (sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k}) + 3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Which is En = sum_{k=1}^{n+1} 3^{k} <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>For n=1: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>sum_{k=1}^{2} 3^{k} = 3 + 9 = 12, which is not equal to 4. So, that doesn't hold. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when n=1, E1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>When n=2, E2 = 15 <nEwLiNe>If I compute sum_{k=1}^{n+1} 3^k for n=1: 3 + 9 = 12 ≠ 4 <nEwLiNe>So, that approach might not be correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps En = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k} + 3^{n} *1 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: 3 + 3 = 6 ≠ 4 <nEwLiNe>No, that doesn't work either. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think of En as a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with a different starting point. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence, En = 3 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, and we already solved it earlier as En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can think of it as En = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from E1 = 4, each En is 3 times (1 + previous term). So, En = 3^{n} * (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + ... + 1/3^{n-1}) ) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that seems off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I can write En as 3^{n} * (c), where c is a constant. <nEwLiNe>But from the general solution, we have En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, En = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>E9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Which is consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think of it as En = (11*3^n - 9)/6, I can factor out 3^n: <nEwLiNe>En = (11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, that's the same as before. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, I keep arriving at 36,084 as the result. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, maybe I can compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))) directly, step by step, without using the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Compute 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, earlier I thought each layer was 3*(1 + previous), but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + that result), right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, in the original problem, the innermost is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)), but in my initial breakdown, I started from 1 + 3 as the innermost. But looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so it's nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, as I did before, layer 1: 4, layer 2: 15, ..., layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>But when I tried to compute it another way, I saw that E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is correct. So, the initial approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think 36,084 is the right answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I try to compute the expression by expanding all the parentheses, it would be a massive expression, but perhaps I can see a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to write out the entire expression step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think about how each layer is built, it's similar to 3 multiplied by the sum of 1 and the previous layer. So, each layer is contributing an additional factor of 3. <nEwLiNe>Given that, the numbers are growing exponentially, which is why the result is so large. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively adding another power of 3 multiplied by some constant. From the general solution, we saw that En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. So, for n=9, it's (11/6)*19683 - 3/2, which again gives us 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) step by step, layer by layer, using the values we computed: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Compute 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's nine layers, and each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So, the pattern is clear, and each step leads to the next. Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, I'll compute 3*(1 + 12027) one more time: <nEwLiNe>1 + 12027 = 12028 <nEwLiNe>3*12028: Let's compute 12028*3. <nEwLiNe>12028 * 3: <nEwLiNe>10000*3 = 30000 <nEwLiNe>2000*3 = 6000 <nEwLiNe>28*3 = 84 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 30000 + 6000 = 36000; 36000 + 84 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying the recurrence relation, solving it with a closed-form formula, and cross-checking each computation, I'm confident that the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is calculated as 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). After computing each of the nine layers, the final result is found to be 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
9,88572,1,7,2954,"
 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. Let me write that down.  <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost expression is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(1 + 3). But wait, we just calculated that (1 + 3) is 4, so this becomes 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13.  <nEwLiNe>Hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... 9 times ...))) So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous result).  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers inside the first multiplication by 3. So, it's 3 times the 9th layer. Hmm, wait, let me check the structure again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. Each ""1 +"" starts a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, 9 layers inside, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, I think my earlier calculation is correct. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each step carefully, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13. Let's compute 3*13: 3*10=30, 3*3=9, so 30+9=39. Then 1 + 39=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40=120. 1 + 120=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. 3*120=360, 3*1=3, so 360 + 3=363. 1 + 363=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*60=180, 3*4=12. So, 900 + 180=1080, 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So, 3000 + 279=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So, 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So, 27000 + 2523=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*29524. Let's compute that. 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. Wait, that might not be the most efficient way. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29524 * 3. Let's compute: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>24*3=72, write down 2, carryover 7 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +7=13, write down 3, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15 +1=16, write down 6, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8 <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 *3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3=88572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:29524 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount, let me recount the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... nine times ...))) So, each time, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of 3s inside. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from 1 + 3, and then each time, you have another 1 + 3*(...). So, 1 + 3 is layer 1, then 1 + 3*(layer1) is layer2, up to layer9, and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers inside, then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 10 layers in total? Wait, no, the first 3 is outside. So, the structure is: 3*(layer9). So, the layers inside the first 3 are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, my earlier calculation is correct. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. <nEwLiNe>We can model this as a recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >=2 <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write down the homogeneous and particular solutions. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is linear and can be written as: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution satisfies a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. The characteristic equation is r - 3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p =1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, n starts at 1? Let me check: a_1=4, which is 1 + 3*1=4. So, yes, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, plugging n=1 into the general solution: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for layer 9, which is the innermost layer before multiplying by 3, we have a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation method, we also arrive at the same result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the previous result). Hmm, so maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the inside. Let me write this down as layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, I see that there are nine sets. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3, then Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9), and so on until Layer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2). So, actually, Layer 1 is the outermost, and Layer 9 is the innermost. That makes sense. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer 9: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake in multiplication or addition. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16. Hmm, 16*3 is 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. 49*3 is 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3. 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding them up: 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Hmm, 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's calculate 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. Adding up: 30000+6000=36000, 36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step calculation, the final result is 36,084. But let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let's count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + result above) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + result above) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many times does this happen? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s inside: Let's see: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), and each time we have another 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, how many layers? It's 9 layers because each subsequent 3 is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and the outermost is Layer 9. So, in my initial calculation, I started from Layer 9 as the innermost, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>So, to confirm, there are 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1 (innermost) as 4, then Layer 2 as 15, up to Layer 9 as 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in my earlier process, Layer 1 was the outermost, which is 3*(1 + 12027). So, perhaps I should number them differently. Maybe it's better to start from the innermost as Layer 1, moving outward to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the previous result. So, regardless of how I number the layers, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive expression? It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's think about it. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: A*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3*A - 3/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>3*A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Because 3/2 is 9/6, so: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>a_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: <nEwLiNe>a_6 = (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: <nEwLiNe>a_7 = (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: <nEwLiNe>a_8 = (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, the formula works. So, using the recurrence relation, we can compute a_9 as 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each layer is 3*(1 + previous), we can think of this as a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 3 each time. But in this case, the closed-form formula is more efficient. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's try to see if we can express the entire expression in terms of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, another approach: notice that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3 + 3*a_2 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_1) = 3 + 9 + 9*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3 + 3*a_3 = 3 + 3*(3 + 9 + 9*a_1) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*a_1 <nEwLiNe>I see a pattern here. Each a_n can be written as 3^n - something. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our general solution, we have a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. Let me see if that can be rewritten. <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 3^n: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But perhaps that's not particularly helpful. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, considering that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), so expanding this recursively: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 9*a_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*a_{n-3}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*a_{n-3} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each step adds another power of 3 and multiplies the coefficient of a_{n - k} by 3^k. <nEwLiNe>So, after expanding k times, we get: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n} * a_0 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to see a_n in terms of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it as we did before, but let's see if we can express a_n in terms of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3 + 3*a_1 = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3 + 3*a_2 = 3 + 45 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3 + 3*a_3 = 3 + 144 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3 + 3*a_4 = 3 + 441 = 444 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, each a_n is 3 more than 3 times the previous term. So, if we unroll the recurrence, we can express a_n as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...)) <nEwLiNe>But that seems complicated. Alternatively, using the closed-form expression is more straightforward. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Calculate 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Add them: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36. 6 goes into 36 six times (6*6=36), remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05. 6 goes into 5 zero times, so write 0. Bring down 0: 50. <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 50 eight times (8*6=48), remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24. 6 goes into 24 four times (4*6=24), remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me try computing a few layers manually again to ensure that my earlier calculations were correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there another way to compute this without expanding each layer? Maybe using exponentiation or another formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, thinking about it, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), which is similar to 3 + 3*previous. So, each term is 3 more than 3 times the previous term. So, the sequence is: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3 + 3*4 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3 + 3*15 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3 + 3*48 = 147 <nEwLiNe>And so on, as before. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if we think about this as a sum, we can express a_n as a sum of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's write out the expansion: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>Expanding this, we can see that a_9 = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 + something. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's try to express a_n in terms of a sum. <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, expanding: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*a_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*(3 + 3*a_{n-3}) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + 3^3*a_{n-3} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this, after k steps: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^k + 3^k*a_{n - k} <nEwLiNe>When k = n - 1: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n - 1} + 3^{n - 1}*a_1 <nEwLiNe>Since a_1 = 4, we have: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n - 1}) + 3^{n - 1}*4 <nEwLiNe>The sum S = 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n - 1} is a geometric series with first term 3, ratio 3, and (n - 1) terms. <nEwLiNe>The sum of a geometric series is S = a*(r^{k} - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term, r is the ratio, and k is the number of terms. <nEwLiNe>So, here, a = 3, r = 3, number of terms = n - 1. <nEwLiNe>Thus, S = 3*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = S + 3^{n - 1}*4 = (3^{n} - 3)/2 + 4*3^{n - 1} <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(3^{n} - 3)/2 + (4*3^{n - 1}) = (3^{n} - 3 + 8*3^{n - 1})/2 <nEwLiNe>But 8*3^{n - 1} = (8/3)*3^n <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^n - 3 + (8/3)*3^n)/2 = ( (1 + 8/3)*3^n - 3 ) / 2 = ( (11/3)*3^n - 3 ) / 2 = (11*3^{n - 1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems different from our earlier formula. Wait, let's compute. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's go back: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n} - 3)/2 + 4*3^{n - 1} <nEwLiNe>= (3^{n} - 3)/2 + (4/3)*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>= [3^{n} - 3 + (8/3)*3^{n}]/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on: 4*3^{n - 1} = (4/3)*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>So, 4*3^{n - 1} = (4/3)*3^n <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^n - 3)/2 + (4/3)*3^n <nEwLiNe>Combine the terms: <nEwLiNe>= [ (3^n)/2 - 3/2 + (4/3)*3^n ] <nEwLiNe>= [ (3^n)*(1/2 + 4/3) - 3/2 ] <nEwLiNe>Compute 1/2 + 4/3: <nEwLiNe>Convert to common denominator: 3/6 + 8/6 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as our earlier formula: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Yes, because (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, either way, we get the same formula. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again step by step, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step is correct. So, I can confidently say that the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this expression as repeatedly applying the operation 3*(1 + previous result) nine times starting from 4. Each time, the value is tripling and adding 3. So, it's exponential growth, which explains why the number gets so large quickly. <nEwLiNe>In conclusion, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and double-checking the arithmetic, I can confirm that the value of the given expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by expanding each layer step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with 1 + 3, each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous result). After computing each layer, the final result is found to be 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
11,36084,0,0,7568,"
 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>So, (1 + 3) equals 4. Got that. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, it's 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12. Okay, so that middle part simplifies to 12. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving another layer out, the next expression is (1 + 12). Let me compute that: 1 + 12 is 13. Then, multiplying by 3, we get 3*13, which is 39. Hmm, so far, so good. Each time, I compute the innermost part, substitute it, and then move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to outline this step by step to make sure I don't get lost. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost, let's denote each step as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me assign each layer a number from inside out. Let's say Layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2). Wait, no, actually, looking back, it's 3*(1 + Layer 2). Wait, let me correct that.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to label each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer as Layer 2, Layer 3, etc., up to Layer 9 because I can see there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me count: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another set of parentheses. So, yes, there are nine layers.  <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on a second. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, is Layer 9 the outermost one? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are nine sets of ""1 + 3(...)"", each nested inside the previous one. So, indeed, there are nine layers, so Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my earlier breakdown, I labeled Layer 1 as (1 + 3), which is correct. Then each subsequent layer is either 3*(previous) or (1 + previous). But actually, looking at the structure, it alternates between 3*(...) and (1 + ...). So, perhaps my earlier labeling is a bit off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think of each pair of parentheses as a layer, so starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Starting with (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3(...)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me correct my earlier approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from the innermost term, which is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, maybe it's better to define the terms step by step: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers, starting from 1. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier breakdown, f(2) was 12. Hmm, now I'm confused. Maybe my initial approach was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the structure. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the left, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had different numbers. So which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I messed up the layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>First, compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this seems different from the f(n) approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I'm getting confused because the structure alternates between 3*(...) and (1 + ...). Let me parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>Then, compute 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has nine layers, so does that mean we have nine operations? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ... steps. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(Layer 1) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + Layer 2) = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(Layer 3) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: (1 + Layer 4) = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(Layer 5) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: (1 + Layer 6) = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(Layer 7) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + Layer 8) = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the outermost 3*(Layer 9) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my previous attempt, I thought Layer 9 was the outermost, but in this case, the outermost is 3*(...), so maybe Layer 9 is (1 + 363) = 364, and then Layer 10 is 3*364 = 1092. But the original expression only has nine layers, so perhaps the outermost is Layer 9, which is 3*(...). Hmm, I'm getting confused. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to count the number of 3*(1 + ... terms. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>But the original expression only has nine layers, so perhaps the outermost is step 9, which is 484, and then multiplied by 3, but no, the structure is that each layer is 3*(1 + ...). Wait, no, the entire expression is 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...), which is step 10, but the original expression only has nine layers, so maybe I'm overcounting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, compute (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, compute 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, compute (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, compute 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, compute (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, compute 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>But the original expression only has nine layers, so maybe I'm including an extra step. Let me check the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""1 + 3("" after the first 3: There are nine ""1 + 3("" sections, each nested within the previous one. So, that would mean nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the outermost is the ninth layer, which would be 3*(1 + ...), resulting in 1455. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 10 steps, which might be because I was counting both the 3*(...) and (1 + ...) as separate layers, but perhaps each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a single layer, so nine layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to define f(n) where n is the number of layers, and f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this gives f(9) = 36084, which is different from the 1455 I got earlier. So which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arises from how we define the layers. If we define f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then f(1) = 4, f(2) = 15, f(3) = 48, etc., up to f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I did the step-by-step earlier, I got 1455, which is different. So I must be making a mistake in counting the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of ""1 + 3*(...)"". <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 484) = 1455. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that would be ten layers, but the original expression only has nine. So, perhaps I'm including an extra step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the original expression has nine layers, so the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer would be Layer 10: 3*(1 + 484) = 1455. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression only has nine layers, so perhaps the outermost is Layer 9: 484, and the entire expression is 3*(1 + 484) = 1455. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that would mean that the original expression has ten layers, which contradicts the initial count. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting after the first 3, we have: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), which is nine layers deep. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the correct way is to compute it as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I got 1455, which is different. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me try to compute it step by step, carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, compute (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, compute 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, compute (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, compute 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, compute (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, compute 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>But the original expression only has nine layers, so perhaps the outermost is step 9, which is 484, and then multiplied by 3, but no, the structure is that each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the outermost is step 10, which is 1455. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3("" is a layer. Starting from the first 3, the first layer is 1 + 3(...), then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So, there are nine ""1 + 3("" layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is the ninth one, which would be 3*(1 + ...), resulting in 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my step-by-step, I ended up with 1455, which is different. So, I must be miscounting the layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model it as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, and compute up to f(9). <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I got 1455, which is f(10) = 1455. So, perhaps the original expression has nine layers, meaning f(9) = 36084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that's ten steps, but the original expression only has nine layers. So, perhaps the outermost is 3*(1 + 484) = 1455, which is the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to compute it step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving out, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, compute (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, compute 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, compute (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, compute 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, compute (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, compute 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 1455. <nEwLiNe>But according to the f(n) approach, f(9) = 36084. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the f(n) approach defines f(n) as the value after n layers, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...), which would correspond to f(10) = 1455. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the original expression has nine layers, each being 3*(1 + ...), so f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me look at the structure again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of times we apply 3*(1 + ...) is nine times. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4, up to f(9). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed step-by-step, I got 1455, which would be f(10). So, perhaps I'm miscounting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers. So, with nine layers, we have nine multiplications by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to compute it as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), starting from f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I did the step-by-step, I ended up with 1455, which is f(10). So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 36084, as per the f(n) approach, since the original expression has nine layers, each being 3*(1 + ...), starting from (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think the correct answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but to confirm, let me compute it step by step again, carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, compute 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, compute (1 + 15) = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, compute 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, compute (1 + 51) = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, compute 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, compute (1 + 159) = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, compute 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, compute (1 + 483) = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, compute 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>But this is ten steps, which suggests that the original expression has ten layers, but the initial count was nine. So, perhaps the confusion is in whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the original expression has nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3). Therefore, the outermost is the ninth layer, which would be 3*(1 + ...), resulting in 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the number of times we apply 3*(1 + ...) is nine times, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, I think that's the correct approach. Therefore, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but to make sure, let me compute f(9): <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I got 1455, which is f(10). So, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with nine sets of ""1 + 3*(...)"". <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of times we apply 3*(1 + ...) is nine times, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think this is the correct answer. My earlier step-by-step was mistakenly counting an extra layer, leading to 1455, which is incorrect. The correct approach is to recognize that there are nine layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from (1 + 3) = 4, leading to f(9) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the inner layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
12,88572,1,11,3144,"
 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, that simplifies the innermost parentheses to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, the next layer out is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write that down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. Each time, I'm computing 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me make sure I'm counting the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer, and working outwards to the first layer, which is multiplied by 3 at the very end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, let's list each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the layers. Each time, the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from the innermost, which is the 9th parentheses, and then each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, yes, 9 layers in total. So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524*3. Let's do it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let's write it properly: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm that multiplication: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, it's 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the 9th layer. So, 9 layers in total. So, the final multiplication by 3 is correct. <nEwLiNe>But let me cross-verify by computing each layer step by step, perhaps in a table: <nEwLiNe>Layer | Expression | Value <nEwLiNe>-----|------------|------ <nEwLiNe>1    | (1 + 3)    | 4 <nEwLiNe>2    | 1 + 3*4    | 13 <nEwLiNe>3    | 1 + 3*13   | 40 <nEwLiNe>4    | 1 + 3*40   | 121 <nEwLiNe>5    | 1 + 3*121  | 364 <nEwLiNe>6    | 1 + 3*364  | 1093 <nEwLiNe>7    | 1 + 3*1093 | 3280 <nEwLiNe>8    | 1 + 3*3280 | 9841 <nEwLiNe>9    | 1 + 3*9841 | 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's test this formula with our earlier computations. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, the formula works. So, the value after 9 layers is (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524)=88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if we consider the entire expression as 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10}-1)/2, then 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10}-1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2=88572. Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me recompute the multiplication: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>29524*3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12. Write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. Write down 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15. Write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28. Write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. Write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top to bottom: 8 8 5 7 2, which is 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 = 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). So, there are nine layers in total, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost, each time I go out, it's another layer. So, starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(that result), and so on, nine times. Hmm, actually, when I look at it, it's 3 multiplied by a sum that itself contains another 3 multiplied by a sum, and so on. So, perhaps I can represent this as a recursive function or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to write it out step by step. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, where L1 is the innermost. So: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until L9, and then the entire expression is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's straightforward. Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Yes. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. Let's see, 29,524 * 3. 20,000*3=60,000; 9,000*3=27,000; 500*3=1,500; 24*3=72. Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524:  <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 88,572. So, 88,572 ✔️. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct. So, each step was computed correctly, and the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. <nEwLiNe>The general form is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a = 3 and b = 1. <nEwLiNe>The solution for such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * C + (b)/(1 - a), where C is a constant determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, a = 3, which is greater than 1, so the formula is slightly different. Let me recall the formula for such a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>For the recurrence relation x_n = a*x_{n-1} + b, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>x_n = a^{n} * x_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1) <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our case, starting from L1, which is 4. So, if we let x_1 = 4, then x_2 = 1 + 3*x1, and so on. So, the general formula for x_n is: <nEwLiNe>x_n = 3^{n-1} * x1 + (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1) * 1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>Starting with x1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, x2 = 1 + 3*x1 <nEwLiNe>x3 = 1 + 3*x2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*x1) = 1 + 3 + 9*x1 <nEwLiNe>x4 = 1 + 3*x3 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 9*x1) = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27*x1 <nEwLiNe>So, in general, x_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n-1}*x1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, for n=1, x1=4. <nEwLiNe>For n=2, x2=1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>For n=3, x3=1 + 3*13=40. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, as above. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula for x_n is: <nEwLiNe>x_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n-1}*x1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me test this. <nEwLiNe>At n=1: <nEwLiNe>x1 = (3^1 -1)/2 + 3^{0}*4 = (3 -1)/2 + 1*4 = 2/2 + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5. Hmm, but x1 is 4. That doesn't match. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my formula is slightly off. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the formula is x_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2 + 3^{n-1}*x0, where x0 is the initial term. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, the initial term is x1=4. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the indices. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's consider that for each step, we have L_k = 1 + 3*L_{k-1}, starting with L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, L2 = 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>L3=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Let me set up the equation. <nEwLiNe>Assume L_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>Then, substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, equating both sides: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3*B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2*B = 1 <nEwLiNe>So, B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>So, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>L3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Perfect, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, L9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier calculation. Then, the entire expression is 3*L9=3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572 is the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's see if we can find a formula for the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(L9), where L9=(3^{10}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3*( (3^{10}-1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}=177147 <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's another way to compute it. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or directly compute the expression, I get the same result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Since we've simplified the innermost part, let's substitute that result into the next layer. The next layer is: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me check. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, after the innermost (1 + 3) is 4, the next layer is 1 + 3(4). So, yeah, that's 1 + 12, which is 13. Let me write that: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving out another layer, we have another 3 times (1 plus something). The next layer would be: <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 13)\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + the previous result). So, it's 3*(1 + 13). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 13) = 3 \times 14 = 42\) <nEwLiNe>Hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this right. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, wait, now I'm confused. Is it 3*(1 + previous result) or (1 + 3*(previous result))? Because in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by the next layer). So, it's not just 3*(1 + previous), but 3*(1 + 3*(previous)). Hmm, that changes things. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Wait, but hold on, is it 3*(1 + 3*(4))? Wait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + that result). Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). <nEwLiNe>So, actually, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. So, when I did the steps above, I went through 9 layers, ending up with 108255. But let me verify each step carefully to avoid mistakes. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6.

Outermost: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, starting from 1, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps I have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...) starting from the innermost (1 + 3). So, let me count the layers again: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost as layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, the outermost 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, so maybe the outermost is the 9th layer. Let me check: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(...): Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is the innermost, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3(...) is 9. So, the outermost is the 9th layer. So, after computing 9 layers, we get 36084, but then the entire expression is multiplied by 3 again? Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(1 + something). So, if there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps the total is 108255 as I calculated earlier. <nEwLiNe>But let me try to think of it recursively. Let me denote a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, starting from the innermost, I had (1 + 3) = 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15. So, perhaps f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>If that's the case, then f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, because f(1) would be the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4, but actually, f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Wait, I'm getting confused. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps f(n) represents the value after n layers. So, starting from n=1: f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>n=2: f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>n=3: f(3) = 3*(1 + f(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>n=4: f(4) = 3*(1 + f(3)) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>n=5: f(5) = 3*(1 + f(4)) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>n=6: f(6) = 3*(1 + f(5)) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>n=7: f(7) = 3*(1 + f(6)) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>n=8: f(8) = 3*(1 + f(7)) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>n=9: f(9) = 3*(1 + f(8)) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, now this is different from my earlier step-by-step. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first approach, I considered the innermost as (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, that would be: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>But in the recursive function f(n) approach, I have f(1) = 12, f(2) = 39, etc., leading to f(9) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc., up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in the recursive function, if we define f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then f(1) = 4, f(2) = 15, f(3)=48, etc. <nEwLiNe>But in the previous recursive approach, I defined f(1) as 3*(1 + 3) = 12, which is different. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the confusion is whether the innermost is just (1 + 3) or 3*(1 + 3). Looking back at the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, and each layer outwards is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, that would be: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>And then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, if we have 9 layers inside, the total expression would have 10 layers? No, let me count the number of 3's. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write the expression with layer numbers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 3*(1 + previous) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, if Layer 9 is the innermost, then the outermost is Layer 10: 3*(1 + Layer 9). But in the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer. So, starting from the first 3(1 +, then each subsequent 3(1 + is a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the innermost is the 9th layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer from 1 to 9 is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, layer 1: 3*(1 + layer 2), but wait, that's confusing. Wait, no, layer 1 is the outermost, layer 9 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + layer 7) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + layer 6) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + layer 5) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer 4) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + layer 3) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + layer 2) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that contradicts my earlier step-by-step because now layer 1 is 36084, but the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer 9). Wait, no, actually, in this numbering, layer 1 is the outermost, so the entire expression is layer 1: 3*(1 + layer 2). So, if layer 2 is 12027, then layer 1 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the outermost is layer 1: 3*(1 + ...). So, if we have 9 layers, layer 1 is the outermost, layer 9 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, starting from layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + layer 9) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + layer 8) = 48 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + layer 2) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if layer 2 is 12027, then layer 1 would be 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But that seems inconsistent with the step-by-step where layer 9 is 36084. So, perhaps my layer numbering is off. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the number of times we apply the 3*(1 + ...) operation. So, starting with 4, then applying 3*(1 + x) eight more times. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting with 4, we apply the operation 8 more times. <nEwLiNe>So, let's define x₀ = 4 <nEwLiNe>x₁ = 3*(1 + x₀) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>x₂ = 3*(1 + x₁) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>x₃ = 3*(1 + x₂) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>x₄ = 3*(1 + x₃) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>x₅ = 3*(1 + x₄) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>x₆ = 3*(1 + x₅) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>x₇ = 3*(1 + x₆) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>x₈ = 3*(1 + x₇) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, after 8 applications, we get x₈ = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression has 9 layers, meaning we need to apply the operation 9 times. Wait, but the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is x₀. Then, applying the operation 8 more times to get x₈ = 36084. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + x₈) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems to be the case. Therefore, the final result is 108255. <nEwLiNe>But to double-check, let's try computing it step by step manually: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out one layer: <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final answer is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me try to compute a smaller version of the problem to see if my method is correct. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using my method: <nEwLiNe>x₀ = 4 <nEwLiNe>x₁ = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>x₂ = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 48, which is correct because 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)) = 3(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, if we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))). <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 4 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 444. <nEwLiNe>Using my method: <nEwLiNe>x₀ = 4 <nEwLiNe>x₁ = 15 <nEwLiNe>x₂ = 48 <nEwLiNe>x₃ = 147 <nEwLiNe>x₄ = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>So, it works for smaller cases. Therefore, my method seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, applying it to the original problem with 9 layers, the result is 108,255. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is calculated as 3 times (1 plus the previous result). After computing all 9 layers, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{108255}$"
15,36084,0,0,5385,"
 Looking at the expression, it starts with 3(1 + ...). The innermost part is the last (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression would be 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(innermost result). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, no. Hold on. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of 3s in the expression to see how many layers there are. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the left, each 3 is the start of a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 3(...). Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9, which is just 1 + 3. Then each layer before that is 3*(1 + result of the next layer). So, let me try to write each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so Layer 1 is the outermost layer, and that's the result? Let me verify this step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. So, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the result of the next layer). So, working from the inside out, each time substituting the inner result into the next layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me try computing this in a different way to verify. Maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer manually.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, this is similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the layers as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L9 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + L9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L1. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, starting from L9, each subsequent L is 3*(1 + L_next). So, maybe we can model this as a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me think about solving this recurrence. Suppose we have L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n+1}), for n from 1 to 8, with L9 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, if we index from the innermost, L9 = 4, then L8 = 3*(1 + L9), L7 = 3*(1 + L8), etc., up to L1. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can reverse the indexing and let L1 be the innermost, but it might complicate things. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, think of it as a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me see. Let's consider the general form: <nEwLiNe>If we have L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), starting from L1 = 4, and going up to L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, the innermost is L9 = 4, and each outer layer is 3*(1 + L_next). So, actually, starting from L9, we can express each layer in terms of the next. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's reverse the order. Let me define L1 as the innermost, so L1 = 4, then L2 = 3*(1 + L1), L3 = 3*(1 + L2), and so on up to L9. <nEwLiNe>But in the original problem, the expression has 9 layers, starting with 3*(...). So, if I reverse the order, L1 would be the outermost, but perhaps it's easier to model. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should instead consider the entire expression as a function that repeats 9 times. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...), so maybe it's similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think about the pattern in the numbers we got: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers, each layer is 3 times the previous layer minus something? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From Layer9 to Layer8: 4 to 15: 15 = 3*5, but 5 = 1 + 4. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer8 to Layer7: 15 to 48: 48 = 3*16, and 16 = 1 + 15. <nEwLiNe>So, each Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n+1)). <nEwLiNe>So, each term is 3*(1 + next term). So, we can write: <nEwLiNe>Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n+1)) <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation where each term depends on the next term. That's a bit unusual because typically, recurrence relations depend on previous terms, not future ones. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps we can solve this recurrence. Let's try. <nEwLiNe>Given that Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n+1)), and we know Layer9 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as Layer(n) - 3*Layer(n+1) = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is Layer(n) - 3*Layer(n+1) = 0, which can be rewritten as Layer(n+1) = (1/3)*Layer(n). The characteristic equation would be r = 1/3, so the homogeneous solution is Layer_h(n) = C*(1/3)^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer_p(n) = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Layer(n) = Layer_h(n) + Layer_p(n) = C*(1/3)^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Wait, but our initial condition is Layer9 = 4. So, when n=9, Layer(9) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*(1/3)^9 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 5.5 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, <nEwLiNe>C = (11/2) / (1/3)^9 = (11/2) * 3^9 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>C = (11/2) * 19683 = (11 * 19683)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11 * 19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, <nEwLiNe>C = 216513 / 2 = 108256.5 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is Layer(n) = 108256.5*(1/3)^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but n here is starting from 1? Or from 9? Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the indices. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our earlier definition, n=9 corresponds to Layer9, n=8 corresponds to Layer8, etc., up to n=1 corresponds to Layer1. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence, we defined Layer(n) in terms of Layer(n+1). So, when n=9, Layer(9) = 4, and n decreases from there. <nEwLiNe>But in the general solution, n is just an index, so perhaps we need to adjust it accordingly. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express the solution in terms of k, where k = 9 - n. <nEwLiNe>But this might complicate things. Alternatively, let's consider that Layer(n) = C*(1/3)^{9 - n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, because when n=9, Layer(9) = C*(1/3)^0 - 3/2 = C - 3/2 = 4, so C = 4 + 3/2 = 5.5 = 11/2, which is consistent with earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my earlier expression for C was off because of the indexing. Let me re-examine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when n=9, Layer(9) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Using the general solution: <nEwLiNe>Layer(n) = C*(1/3)^{n} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*(1/3)^9 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, C*(1/3)^9 = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, <nEwLiNe>C = (11/2) / (1/3)^9 = (11/2) * 3^9 = (11/2)*19683 = (11*19683)/2 = 216513 / 2 = 108256.5 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer(n) = 108256.5*(1/3)^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But we need to find Layer(1), which is the outermost layer, right? Wait, no, actually, in our earlier computation, Layer1 was the outermost, which was 36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to this formula, when n=1: <nEwLiNe>Layer(1) = 108256.5*(1/3)^1 - 3/2 = 108256.5/3 - 1.5 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our manual computation! So, that's a good sign. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula gives Layer(1) = 36084, which is the value of the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>So, without computing each layer manually, we can use the recurrence relation and solve it to get the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize the pattern in the layers. Each time, you're multiplying by 3 and adding 3. Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 15 = 3*5 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 48 = 3*16 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 147 = 3*49 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 444 = 3*148 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1335 = 3*445 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 4008 = 3*1336 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 12027 = 3*4009 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 36084 = 3*12028 <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3 times one more than the previous layer. So, 3*(1 + previous). So, the numbers inside the parentheses are 5, 16, 49, 148, 445, 1336, 4009, 12028. <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers: 5, 16, 49, 148, 445, 1336, 4009, 12028. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, each of these numbers seems to be 4, 5, 16, 49, 148, 445, 1336, 4009, 12028. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4 is Layer9, 5 is 1 + Layer9, 16 is 1 + Layer8, etc. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps we can see a pattern here. Let's compute the ratio between consecutive terms: <nEwLiNe>16 / 5 = 3.2 <nEwLiNe>49 / 16 ≈ 3.0625 <nEwLiNe>148 / 49 ≈ 3.0204 <nEwLiNe>445 / 148 ≈ 3.0068 <nEwLiNe>1336 / 445 ≈ 3.0022 <nEwLiNe>4009 / 1336 ≈ 3.00075 <nEwLiNe>12028 / 4009 ≈ 3.0000 <nEwLiNe>So, each ratio is approaching 3 from above. So, as n increases, the ratio approaches 3. <nEwLiNe>Which makes sense because each term is 3*(1 + next term), so as we go further out, the impact of the ""+1"" becomes less significant, and the ratio approaches 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the numbers inside the parentheses are approaching a geometric progression with ratio 3, but each term is slightly more than 3 times the previous because of the ""+1"". <nEwLiNe>But I don't know if that helps us compute it any faster, but it's an interesting observation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model the entire expression as a sum. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, it's like 3 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as a continued multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding it: <nEwLiNe>Layer1 = 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3 + 3*Layer2 <nEwLiNe>Layer2 = 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3 + 3*Layer3 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer9 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, substituting recursively: <nEwLiNe>Layer1 = 3 + 3*Layer2 <nEwLiNe>But Layer2 = 3 + 3*Layer3 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer1 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*Layer3) = 3 + 9 + 9*Layer3 <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer3 = 3 + 3*Layer4 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer1 = 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*Layer4) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*Layer4 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, each substitution adds another power of 3 and multiplies the next layer by the next power of 3. <nEwLiNe>So, in the end, Layer1 would be the sum of 3^1 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^9 minus something? Wait, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each substitution adds a term and multiplies the next layer by 3. So, if we go all the way to Layer9, which is 4, then: <nEwLiNe>Layer1 = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ... + 3*(4)...))) <nEwLiNe>So, this would expand to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^8*4 <nEwLiNe>So, it's a sum of 3^k from k=1 to k=8, each multiplied by 4, except the last term. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each substitution step adds a term and multiplies the remaining expression by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote S = Layer1 = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Then, S = 3*(1 + S'), where S' is the next layer. <nEwLiNe>But S' = 3*(1 + S''), and so on, until the innermost is 4. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I expand S: <nEwLiNe>S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Expanding step by step: <nEwLiNe>First, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, computing each layer step by step gives us 36084. So, that's the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, as we saw earlier, using the recurrence relation, we can model this and arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying through the recurrence relation, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost part: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: \(3 \times 4 = 12\). <nEwLiNe>3. Add 1 and multiply by 3: \(3 \times (1 + 12) = 3 \times 13 = 39\). <nEwLiNe>4. Continue this process for each layer, each time taking the result, adding 1, multiplying by 3, and proceeding outward. <nEwLiNe>Following this method, we compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: \(3 \times (1 + 12) = 39\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: \(3 \times (1 + 39) = 120\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: \(3 \times (1 + 120) = 363\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: \(3 \times (1 + 363) = 1092\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: \(3 \times (1 + 1092) = 3279\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: \(3 \times (1 + 3279) = 9840\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: \(3 \times (1 + 9840) = 29523\) <nEwLiNe>However, upon re-evaluating the earlier step-by-step computation, it appears there was a miscalculation. Correcting this, the accurate step-by-step computation yields: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: \(3 \times (1 + 12) = 39\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: \(3 \times (1 + 39) = 120\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: \(3 \times (1 + 120) = 363\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: \(3 \times (1 + 363) = 1092\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: \(3 \times (1 + 1092) = 3279\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: \(3 \times (1 + 3279) = 9840\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: \(3 \times (1 + 9840) = 29523\) <nEwLiNe>But this contradicts the earlier detailed computation which resulted in 36084. To resolve this discrepancy, it's clear that the initial detailed computation was accurate, arriving at 36084. Therefore, the correct result is: <nEwLiNe>\(\boxed{36084}\"
16,,0,0,65536,"
 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But then, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, this is different from my initial thought where I thought each layer was 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>So, let's re-express. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 = (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), since starting from the innermost, which is just (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 3*(1 + ...). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer out is 3*(1 + 3*(previous result)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each time, it's 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, this is different from my initial thought where I thought each layer was 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>So, let's re-express. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 = (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), since starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there?

Wait, no, actually, each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is not multiplied by 3. Then, each layer out is 3*(1 + ...).

So, the first 3*( is the outermost, then the next 3*( is inside it, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 8, because after the first 3*(, there are 8 more 3*( inside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total number of layers is 9, with the innermost being (1 + 3) = 4, and then 8 layers of 3*(1 + 3*...). <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is Layer9, which is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought Layer9 was 188,329,404, but in my initial computation, I stopped at Layer8 as 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the original expression has 8 or 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3*(, then each subsequent 3*( is inside. <nEwLiNe>So, the first 3*( is the outermost, then the next 3*( is inside it, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 8, because after the innermost, there are 8 more layers of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))). <nEwLiNe>So, that's 8 layers of 3*(1 + 3*...), starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3189 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 28704 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 258339 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>So, f(8) is the result of 8 layers, which is 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), so the total expression is f(8) = 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought f(9) was 188,329,404, but that would be if there were 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers is 8, because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), we have 8 more layers each multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm by manually expanding the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258,339 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489 <nEwLiNe>So, after 8 layers, we get 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought f(9) was 188,329,404, but that would require 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, it's only 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), so the total is 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3*(, each subsequent 3*( is inside. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...) layers: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3*(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), so the number of 3*(1 + ...) is 8, because starting from the first 3*(, there are 8 more 3*( inside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is f(8) = 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check by computing each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(118) = 354 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1063) = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(9568) = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(86113) = 258,339 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(775,018) = 2,325,054 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(6,975,163) = 20,925,489 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), since starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...).

Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result, and then another 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, it's like each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, this seems like it could form a pattern or a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer step by step. I'll start from the innermost and move outward. <nEwLiNe>Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, and so on, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 would be 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer would be 3*(L9). Wait, no, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3, except the innermost one which is just 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, each layer is a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me reindex them correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, no. Wait, in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is L1, then each subsequent layer is L2, L3, up to L9, and then the outermost is 3*(L9). So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 40, and so on until L9. But the entire expression is 3*(L9). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied the layers before. Perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous layer). Let me try this approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L1 as the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, is L9 the outermost? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) parts. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new layer.

Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), since starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each outer layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer.

 Looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me note that down. <nEwLiNe>Starting Point: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, it would be 3*(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First Layer: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Next, moving another layer out, we have another (1 + ...) where the ... is the previous result. So, it's (1 + 12).

Let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression has multiple layers, so I need to ensure I'm peeling them off correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the structure: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, it's 9. So, there are 9 layers in total. Let me check how many layers I've processed so far. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that was the first layer. Then each subsequent layer added another 3*(1 + ...). So, each time I go out a layer, I'm adding another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, I have 9 layers to compute. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of times I've done the computation: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 12) = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 39) = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 120) = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>9.

(1 + 9840) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3*(9841) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so I think I went too far. Wait, the original expression has 9 layers of nesting. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time I have an opening parenthesis, that's a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, let's count the number of layers: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) – Layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + Layer1) – Layer2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + Layer2) – Layer3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + Layer3) – Layer4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + Layer4) – Layer5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + Layer5) – Layer6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + Layer6) – Layer7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + Layer7) – Layer8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + Layer8) – Layer9 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so there are 9 layers. But in my previous computation, I went up to 16 steps. That seems inconsistent. So maybe I need to adjust. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I'm counting the layers correctly, but the expression has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each time, we have a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me try a different approach: let me denote each layer as a step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me define: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to a_9, since there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) so it's 3*(a_9), where a_9 is 1 + 3*(a_8), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, etc., up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, if I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, I can iteratively compute a_1 to a_9, then multiply the last term by 3. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute each a_n step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify this computation step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a_1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression: 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me compute 3*29524 again to be absolutely sure. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit by 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>Break it into 20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4 <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 3*29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for a_n to avoid computing each step manually, but given that there are only 9 layers, it's manageable. <nEwLiNe>But for thoroughness, let me check if my a_n computations are correct. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, all steps check out. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Let me see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 ⇒ r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 1 ⇒ -2*C = 1 ⇒ C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 ⇒ 4 = 3*A - 1/2 ⇒ 3*A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 ⇒ A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3=(3^4 -1)/2=(81-1)/2=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243-1)/2=242/2=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, this formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Which matches our previous computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think this is solid.

 Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies the next layer. The next layer out is 3 times that result. So, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Actually, looking back, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous result). So, perhaps I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression with placeholders for each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3( ... )) parts. Starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer out is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3( inside: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems like 9 layers? Wait, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Total layers: from the innermost to the outermost, there are 9 layers. Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that would be 9 layers? Let me verify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, the expression has 9 sets of parentheses? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many 3*(1 + ... are there. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is built upon the previous. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recurrence relation. Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is a_9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let me count the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost. So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, all the steps check out. Each a_n is correctly calculated as 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous result). After computing up to a_9, we get 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me just make sure that I didn't miscount the number of layers. Because sometimes when you have nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the number of iterations. <nEwLiNe>Let me write out the expression structure: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 9 layers in total. So, starting from the innermost, each layer builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 each time after adding 1. So, 9 layers lead us to 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern in the numbers. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the results: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at the pattern, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's a recurrence relation of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant each time. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can express this recurrence relation in a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2C = 3 <nEwLiNe>C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Wait, actually, let's make sure about the indexing. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to 8/2: <nEwLiNe>8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>So, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Perfect, the formula works. So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683: Let's compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36000 = 216000 <nEwLiNe>216504 - 216000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36084, which matches our previous computation. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I get the same result, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify the closed-form computation again. <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>For n=9: <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>11*19683: 10*19683=196830; 1*19683=19683; total=196830+19683=216513 <nEwLiNe>216513 - 9 = 216504 <nEwLiNe>216504 ÷ 6: 216504 divided by 6. <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>So, 36084. Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36000 = 216000 <nEwLiNe>216504 - 216000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>Total: 36000 + 84 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods confirm that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I've checked each step, used two different methods (step-by-step computation and recurrence relation), and both lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

 Looking at the expression, it seems each ""1 + 3(...)"" is nested inside another. The innermost one is the last part: 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Since the previous result was 4, it becomes 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now that layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*13: that's 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 40. Next layer out: 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 121. That's interesting. Let me keep track of these numbers: 4, 13, 40, 121... It seems like each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. Let me check that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from 4: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 + 1 = 13. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>13 * 3 + 1 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>40 * 3 + 1 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, this pattern seems consistent. So, each time, it's multiplying the previous number by 3 and adding 1. So, maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost term as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, let me check how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 layers of nesting because each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me count: starting from the innermost, which is a_1, then each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3,... up to a_9. So, the outermost layer is 3 times a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, let me list them again with their indices: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>But maybe it's easier to compute directly: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*       3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+2=8. <nEwLiNe>So yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating a_9. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute a_9 step by step: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, a_9 is indeed 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Since each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d is a_n = c^n * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). But let me recall the exact formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, for a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = c^{n} * a_0 + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). Is that right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me test with our numbers. Here, c=3, d=1. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + 1*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). <nEwLiNe>But wait, our a_1 is 4, which is when n=1. <nEwLiNe>So, maybe the formula is a_n = 3^{n} * a_0 + (3^{n} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But we need to find a_0. <nEwLiNe>From a_1 = 1 + 3*a_0. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4, so 4 = 1 + 3*a_0 => 3*a_0 = 3 => a_0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3^{n} * 1 + (3^{n} - 1)/2 = 3^{n} + (3^{n} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: 3^{n} + (3^{n}/2 - 1/2) = (2*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 1)/2 = (3*3^{n} -1)/2 = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2= 8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the formula is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct, as before. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I use the formula, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or find the closed-form expression, I end up with the same answer: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top to bottom: 8,8,5,7,2. Wait, that would be 88572. Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hang on, when multiplying 29524 by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the units digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572.

 Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. So, let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next parentheses is: 1 + 3(...). The ... here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, substituting that in, we have: <nEwLiNe>2. Compute 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. The next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So yes, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3*(...). The previous result was 13, so: <nEwLiNe>3. Compute 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(40).

Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Continuing to the next layer: 1 + 3*(1093).

So, I feel confident that 797,160 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be applied here instead of computing each layer step by step, which could help verify the result more efficiently. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the number of layers, then: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9, since there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). Wait, actually, counting the layers: starting from the innermost (1+3), that's layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so up to layer 9. Then the outermost operation is 3*(a_9). So, a_9 is the innermost 9 layers, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps this is a geometric series or follows a recursive formula. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can try to find a closed-form solution for a_n. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer n, a_n is given by that formula. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on: Let's clarify the indexing. The innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9, which is the result before the outermost multiplication. So, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>3^{11} is 177,147. So, 177,147 - 3 = 177,144. Then, 177,144 / 2 = 88,572. Wait, but that's not matching my previous result of 797,160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. There must be a misunderstanding in the indexing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: Each a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. So, a_1 corresponds to the innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then a_2 is the next layer, etc., up to a_9, which would be the result of the 9th layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2,187, 3^8=6,561, 3^9=19,683, 3^{10}=59,049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my step-by-step computation earlier, a_9 was 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. But that's conflicting with my previous result of 797,160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so where is the confusion? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each parenthesis adds another layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(...): There are 9 instances of 3(...), each nested inside the previous one. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 is the result of the innermost 9 layers, which is 29,524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step computation, I went up to 265,720, then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1,093) = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3,280) = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9,841) = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*(29,524) = 88,573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I miscounted earlier. The original expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3(...). So, starting from (1 + 3), which is layer 1, up to layer 9, which is (1 + 3*(...)), and then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 12 steps, which suggests that I was counting the outermost 3*(...) as step 12, but actually, the layers inside are 9, so the outermost 3*(...) is separate. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify. <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times ... + 3))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), and there are 9 such layers inside the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 265,720, then multiplied by 3. That suggests that I was considering 11 layers instead of 9. So, I think I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: Let's count the number of 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time we have 3*(...). Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...9 times...))) <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*(something), where the something has 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, with the final multiplication by 3 outside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 9, so a_9 = 29,524, and 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial computation, I went up to 265,720, which would be a_11, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. So, that suggests that I considered 11 layers instead of 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's recount the number of layers in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, the number of 3(...) is 9, as each ""3("" corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it down: <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent 3( is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 instances of 3(, each nested inside the previous one. Therefore, the innermost is the 9th 3(, which is 3(1 + 3). Then, each layer is built outward. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29,524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed 12 layers, which suggests I miscounted. Let me recount my steps: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29,524 = 88,573 <nEwLiNe>11. Next: 1 + 3*88,573 = 265,720 <nEwLiNe>12. Outermost: 3*265,720 = 797,160 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, there are 12 layers, but the expression only has 9 instances of 3(...). So, there's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the total layers inside the outermost 3*(...) are 9, so a_9 = 29,524, then 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial computation, I went beyond that, computing up to a_11 and then multiplying by 3. So, perhaps the issue is whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... has 9 layers. So, the total layers are 9 inside the outermost multiplication. Therefore, a_9 = 29,524, then 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, I continued beyond that, which suggests that I was considering the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, making it 10 layers, but that's not the case. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the expression is structured such that the outermost 3*(...) is separate, and the inner part has 9 layers. So, the inner part is a_9 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial computation, I went up to 265,720, which would be a_11, and then multiplied by 3. So, I think the confusion is arising from whether the outermost 3*(...) is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the expression again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we have (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of 3*(...) is 9, each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed beyond that, which suggests that I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" is a new layer.

Therefore, the innermost is a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 13, up to a_9 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I continued beyond 9 layers, treating the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it is not. The outermost operation is just multiplying the result of the 9 layers by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572, not 797,160. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let's double-check the formula. <nEwLiNe>We have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_11 = 265,720, then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. So, that suggests that I considered 11 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), but actually, it's only 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the expression has more layers than I thought. Let me count again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me write it with each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond Layer 9, computing up to Layer 11. So, that suggests that I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the expression is longer than I thought. Let me count the number of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a new layer.

The outermost operation is just multiplying the result of the 9 layers by 3, not adding another layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial conclusion of 797,160 was incorrect because I treated the outermost multiplication as another layer, making it 11 layers instead of 9. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, the expression has 9 layers inside the outermost 3*(...), so the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify with the formula again. <nEwLiNe>We have a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the layers, treating the outermost 3*(...) as another layer, which it is not. The correct number of layers inside the outermost multiplication is 9, leading to the result 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, now I'm confused because the formula suggests 88,572, but in my initial step-by-step, I got 797,160. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's re-examine the formula. <nEwLiNe>We had the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We solved it and got a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula for n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 265,720, which would be a_11, and then multiplied by 3 to get 797,160. <nEwLiNe>So, I think the confusion is that I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3*(...) in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer.

So, where is the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial 3*(...) is considered a layer as well. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...9 times...))) <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost operation is 3*(...), which is a layer, making it 10 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if that's the case, then the total layers are 10: the outermost 3*(...) is layer 10, and inside it, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the formula, a_n corresponds to the n-th layer inside the outermost multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly. <nEwLiNe>If the outermost operation is layer 10, then a_10 = 3*(1 + 3*a_9). <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the formula was derived for the layers inside the outermost multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the outermost multiplication is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where the ... has 9 layers. So, the total layers are 9 inside the outermost multiplication, and the outermost operation is just multiplying that result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total layers are 9 inside, and the outermost multiplication is not considered a layer but just an operation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 is applicable for the n layers inside the outermost multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524, then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, I treated the outermost multiplication as another layer, making it 10 layers in total, leading to a different result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, to resolve this, I need to clarify: is the outermost 3*(...) considered a layer or not? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first 3(, which is the outermost, and each subsequent 3( is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost is Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total layers are 9, each corresponding to a 3*(...) operation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is Layer 9: 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but wait, no. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is that the formula counts the number of 3*(...) operations, not the number of layers including the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think differently. <nEwLiNe>If I denote each 3*(...) as a layer, then the number of layers is 9, starting from the outermost. <nEwLiNe>But in the formula, a_n corresponds to the n-th layer starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps the formula is applicable for n layers starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if we have 9 layers starting from the innermost, then a_9 = 29,524, and the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, I computed 12 layers, treating each 3*(...) as a layer, starting from the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps the confusion is in the direction of counting: whether we start from the innermost or the outermost. <nEwLiNe>If we count from the innermost, there are 9 layers, leading to a_9 = 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>If we count from the outermost, there are 9 layers, leading to a different result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted accordingly. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct as is, and the confusion is that the outermost multiplication is not part of the layers but just an operation outside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to be absolutely certain, let me compute the expression step by step, correctly counting 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 6: 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 7: 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 8: 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8) = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, in this counting, the innermost is Layer 1, and Layer 8 is the result before the outermost multiplication. So, the outermost multiplication is 3*(Layer 8) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, the number of 3*(...) is 9, so perhaps Layer 9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward: 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward: 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, moving outward adds another layer. So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer is Layer 2, Layer 3, etc. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer 9: 1 + 3*(...Layer 8...). <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that makes sense. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1,093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3,280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 9,841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Layer 11, treating the outermost multiplication as another layer, which is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let's verify this with the formula. <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>For n=9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the layers, treating the outermost multiplication as another layer, leading to an incorrect result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to ensure I haven't made any mistake, let me compute it step by step correctly, counting only 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 6: 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 7: 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 8: 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression: 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Substitute back into the next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Continue substituting each result into the next layer: <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1,093\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 1,093 = 3,280\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 3,280 = 9,841\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 9,841 = 29,524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply the result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 29,524 = 88,572\). <nEwLiNe>Thus, the computed value is \(\boxed{88572}\"
