Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected prefix: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go.

Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, up to L9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. Let me write each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is L1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer, that becomes L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So perhaps it's better to define each layer as a term. <nEwLiNe>Let me define it as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say L1 is the innermost expression: (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, L2 would be 3*(1 + L1), L3 is 3*(1 + L2), and so on, until L9, which is the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...). So maybe L1 is the innermost (1 + 3), then L2 is 3*(1 + L1), then L3 is 3*(1 + L2), etc., up to L9. So, starting from L1, we compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>So, let me list each layer: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the entire expression is L9, which is 36084. Hmm, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me verify each step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. Adding them up: 300 + 120 = 420 +24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. Adding up: 1200 + 120 = 1320 +15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Calculating 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding up: 3000 + 900 = 3900 +90=3990 +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let me compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. Adding them: 12000 +27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Calculating 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. Adding them: 36000 +84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step seems to check out. Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that could have been used here instead of computing each layer step by step. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the recursion: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>We can expand this recursion: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation of the form L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b, where a=3 and b=3. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = a^n * C + (b)/(a - 1) <nEwLiNe>Where C is a constant determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Given that L1 = 4, let's find C. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 3^1 * C + 3/(3 - 1) = 3C + 3/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3C = 4 - 3/2 = 5/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, C = (5/2)/3 = 5/6 <nEwLiNe>Hence, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3^n * (5/6) + 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (5/6)*3^n + 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (5*3^{n-1}) + (3/2) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^n * (5/6) = (5/6)*3^n = (5/6)*3*3^{n-1} = (5/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (5/2)*3^{n-1} + 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (1/2)*(5*3^{n-1} + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (5*3^{n-1} + 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = (5*3^{0} + 3)/2 = (5 + 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L2 = (5*3^{1} + 3)/2 = (15 + 3)/2 = 18/2 = 9. Wait, but earlier we had L2=15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So perhaps my general formula is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check my steps again. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, in standard form, it's L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3 <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>A particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation: since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the equation: K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition L1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2 => 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^1 -9)/6 = (33 -9)/6 =24/6=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>(11*9 -9)/6 = (99 -9)/6=90/6=15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>(11*27 -9)/6 = (297 -9)/6=288/6=48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>(11*81 -9)/6= (891 -9)/6=882/6=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the general formula is L_n = (11*3^n -9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: <nEwLiNe>L9 = (11*3^9 -9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L9 = (11*19683 -9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683*10=196830 <nEwLiNe>19683*1=19683 <nEwLiNe>Adding together: 196830 +19683=216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 -9=216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 /6 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷6: 6*36,000=216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 -216,000=504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷6=84 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, total is 36,000 +84=36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, L9=36,084. Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added 3 each time, so the sequence grows exponentially, but computing it step by step or using the formula both lead to the same result. <nEwLiNe>I think I'm confident now that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me assign variables to each layer to make it clearer. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the innermost expression as A₁ = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁. <nEwLiNe>Then, A₃ = 1 + 3*A₂, and so on, until A₉, since there are nine layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with A₁: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Yes, 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So A₂ is 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to A₃: 1 + 3*A₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 40. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*A₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 121. <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*A₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 364. <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*A₅ = 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*364. 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Then, 1 + 1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1093. <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*A₆ = 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*1093: 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Then, 1 + 3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 3280. <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*A₇ = 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>Calculate 3*3280: 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 9841. <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*A₈ = 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841: 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000+2400=29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer, starting from the innermost, we have A₉ = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, looking back at the original expression, it's 3 times A₉. So the entire expression is 3*A₉. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, but that might not be the right way. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's do it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the units digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6, plus 1 carried over is 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6, plus 1 carried over is 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6, plus 2 carried over is 8. <nEwLiNe>So putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps, let me double-check each A₁ to A₉. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A₁: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each Aₙ seems to be following a recurrence relation: Aₙ = 1 + 3*Aₙ₋₁, starting from A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is Aₙ = C*3ⁿ + D, where D is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me find D. Setting Aₙ = D, we get D = 1 + 3*D. <nEwLiNe>Solving for D: D = 1 + 3D => -2D = 1 => D = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>But since our initial condition is A₁ = 4, which is an integer, and the terms are all integers, maybe the homogeneous solution will adjust it. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe this approach is more complicated, but since we only need 9 terms, it's easier to compute step by step as I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>But just for knowledge, the closed-form would be Aₙ = (A₁ - D)*3ⁿ⁻¹ + D. <nEwLiNe>Plugging in A₁ = 4, D = -1/2: <nEwLiNe>Aₙ = (4 - (-1/2))*3ⁿ⁻¹ - 1/2 = (9/2)*3ⁿ⁻¹ - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(9/2)*3ⁿ⁻¹ = (9*3ⁿ⁻¹)/2 = (3²*3ⁿ⁻¹)/2 = 3ⁿ⁺¹ / 2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, Aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, Aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula for n=1: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = (3² - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>A₂ = (3³ - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: <nEwLiNe>A₃ = (3⁴ - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>A₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: <nEwLiNe>3¹ = 3 <nEwLiNe>3² = 9 <nEwLiNe>3³ = 27 <nEwLiNe>3⁴ = 81 <nEwLiNe>3⁵ = 243 <nEwLiNe>3⁶ = 729 <nEwLiNe>3⁷ = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3⁸ = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3⁹ = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3¹⁰ = 59049. <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me clarify. Each layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. Hmm, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer9) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer8) <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer 1, which is the outermost: 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count how many times this happens. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result from 1) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result from 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 +"" is followed by 3 times another parentheses. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The first layer after 3 is (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Repeating until the innermost (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Counting these, I think there are 9 layers in total. Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does 1 + 3 occur? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the string: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, in total, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" introduces a new layer. So starting from the first 3, the number of layers is equal to the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another ""1 + 3("" until the innermost (1 + 3). Let's count the number of ""1 + 3("" instances. <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers. So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3), then layer 8: 1 + 3*(layer9), and so on up to layer1: 3*(layer2). <nEwLiNe>So, let me structure it as: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*Layer8 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer1: 3*Layer2 <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer9 and moving outward. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check these calculations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer9: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 first. <nEwLiNe>364 * 3: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000 + 600 = 9600 +240=9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*9841. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. <nEwLiNe>So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer1: 29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscalculate any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer9: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each step follows logically, and I double-checked each multiplication. So, the final result is 29523. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that this expression is a form of a geometric series or perhaps a recurrence relation. Let me see if I can model it that way. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from the innermost as a_1. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my previous calculation, Layer9 was the innermost, which was a_1 = 4, then Layer8 was a_2 =13, and so on up to Layer1 = a_9 =29523. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's better to model it as a recurrence relation where each term is defined in terms of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, where a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, which was (1 + 3) = 4, which would be a_1 =4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is a_2 =1 + 3*a_1 =1 + 12=13 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_3=1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me recall. The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n -3a_{n-1}=0, which has characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K -3K =1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, a_1=4= C*3^1 -1/2 => 4=3C -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: 4 +1/2=3C => 9/2=3C => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, in our case, the innermost layer was a_1=4. Then, each subsequent layer increments n by 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our previous notation, Layer9 was a_1=4, Layer8 was a_2=13, etc., up to Layer1=a_9=29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in terms of the recurrence, n=1 corresponds to Layer9, n=2 corresponds to Layer8, and so on, up to n=9 corresponding to Layer1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, to find Layer1, which is the outermost layer, we need a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, plugging n=9 into the formula: <nEwLiNe>a_9=(3^{9+1} -1)/2=(3^{10}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's conflicting with our previous result of 29523. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that suggests an inconsistency. Wait, in our step-by-step computation, we got 29523, but using the recurrence relation formula, we got 29524. <nEwLiNe>That's a problem. There must be an error in my reasoning. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check the recurrence relation approach. <nEwLiNe>We had a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution was a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But let's verify for n=1: a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Hmm, but in our step-by-step, Layer1 was 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, so according to the recurrence, a_9=29524, but in our step-by-step, we had Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the step-by-step computation: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3 =4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer1:3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, Layer1 is 29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>In the recurrence, n=1 corresponds to Layer9, n=2 corresponds to Layer8, ..., n=9 corresponds to Layer1. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, a_9=29524, but according to the step-by-step, Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, there must be an error in one of the computations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute Layer1 again: 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9841*3. <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>800*3=2400 <nEwLiNe>40*3=120 <nEwLiNe>1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>Add them up: 27000 +2400=29400; 29400 +120=29520; 29520 +3=29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>So, why the difference? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial condition is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the recurrence, I started with a_1=4, which was Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step, Layer9=4, Layer8=13, ..., Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the recurrence, a_n corresponds to Layer(10 -n). Wait, maybe I misaligned the indices. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps my formula is off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's re-examine the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>We had a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=4, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=40, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=121, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=364, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=1093, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=3280, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=9841, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (3^{10}-1)/2=29524, correct. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step computation, Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to the formula, a_9=29524, but in our manual computation, Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the step-by-step? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's recompute Layer1: 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9841*3: <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>800*3=2400 <nEwLiNe>40*3=120 <nEwLiNe>1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>Adding: 27000 +2400=29400; 29400 +120=29520; 29520 +3=29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the formula, a_9=29524. So, which one is right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my initial assumption about the recurrence was wrong. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>In the expression, starting from the innermost, which is Layer9: (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer8: 1 + 3*(Layer9)=1 + 3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer7:1 +3*13=40, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the formula is a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=59049 -1=59048; 59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>But in our step-by-step, we have Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the outermost layer is not a_9, but a_{10}? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of layers again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a 3(...). Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>- 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the first 3 is followed by 9 opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which itself has 8 more layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the outermost 3 is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our initial step-by-step computation, we considered the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer9, then each subsequent layer moving outward as Layer8, Layer7, etc., up to Layer1 being the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence, a_1 corresponds to Layer9, a_2 to Layer8, ..., a_9 to Layer1. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, a_9=29524, which would correspond to Layer1. <nEwLiNe>But in our manual computation, Layer1=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the formula is off by one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial condition is misapplied. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step, Layer9=4, which is a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer8=13=a_2. <nEwLiNe>Layer7=40=a_3. <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer1=29523=a_9. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step, a_9=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the formula is wrong? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me rederive the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>We have a_n=1 +3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>The particular solution is K, so substituting: <nEwLiNe>K=1 +3*K => K -3K=1 => -2K=1 => K=-1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution: a_n=C*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying initial condition a_1=4: <nEwLiNe>4=C*3^1 -1/2 =>4=3C -1/2 => 3C=4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n=(3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but then why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, how many times does ""1 + 3("" occur? <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>- 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>- 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, after the first 3, there are 9 opening parentheses, each starting a new layer. So, in total, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost layer is Layer9: (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer8:1 + 3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer1:3*(Layer2)=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>So, why is there a difference? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my formula is shifted by one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps n=0 corresponds to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think differently. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we index the layers starting from n=0. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_0=4 (the innermost layer). <nEwLiNe>Then, a_1=1 +3*a_0=1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>a_2=1 +3*a_1=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>a_3=1 +3*a_2=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>a_4=1 +3*a_3=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>a_5=1 +3*a_4=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>a_6=1 +3*a_5=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>a_7=1 +3*a_6=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>a_8=1 +3*a_7=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), not 1 +3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The outermost operation is 3*(...). So, in our initial step-by-step, we had: <nEwLiNe>Layer9:4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:13 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:364 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer1:3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer2)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence, if we define a_0=4, then a_1=13, a_2=40,..., a_8=29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*a_8=3*29524=88572, which is not the case. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer2). So, perhaps the formula is a bit different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is for the inner expression, not including the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in other words, the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the inner expression which can be represented by the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>So, if we let E be the entire expression, then E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))=3*(E'), where E' is the inner expression. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, the inner expression E' is similar to E but with one fewer layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula accordingly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our step-by-step computation, we had Layer1=3*(Layer2)=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, a_9=29524, which is Layer1=29524. <nEwLiNe>But in reality, Layer1=3*Layer2=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the formula is for the inner expression, not including the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in other words, the inner expression E' satisfies E'=1 +3*E'' where E'' is the next inner expression. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, the innermost expression is 4, and each layer builds up. <nEwLiNe>But in the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, which for n=9 gives 29524, but in reality, the outermost layer is 3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps the formula is actually for the expression without the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Suppose I define E as the entire expression: E=3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Then, the inner expression inside the first 3 is 1 + 3*(...), which has 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote E_k as the expression with k layers. <nEwLiNe>So, E_1=1 + 3=4 <nEwLiNe>E_2=1 + 3*E_1=13 <nEwLiNe>E_3=1 + 3*E_2=40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>E_9=1 + 3*E_8 <nEwLiNe>But in our original expression, E=3*E_8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so E=3*E_8. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>But in our computation, E_8=9841, so E=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula gives E_9=29524, but in reality, E=3*E_8=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the formula is E_k=(3^{k+1}-1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, E=3*E_8, and E_8= (3^{9}-1)/2=9841, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E=3*E_8=3*(9841)=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula for E_k is (3^{k+1}-1)/2, where E_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_8=(3^{9}-1)/2=9841. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the entire expression E=3*E_8=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, why did the formula give E_9=29524? Because E_9=1 + 3*E_8=1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, E=3*E_8=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula gives E_9=29524, which is the value of the inner expression with 9 layers, but our expression is 3*(inner expression with 8 layers)=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the confusion arises from whether we're counting the outermost 3 as part of the layers or not. <nEwLiNe>In our step-by-step computation, we considered the outermost operation as Layer1=3*Layer2=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence, if we define E_1=4, E_2=13,...,E_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>But our expression is 3*E_8=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29523. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the initial step-by-step computation is correct, and the formula gives E_9=29524, which is not our expression, but one layer deeper. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully checking both methods and realizing the discrepancy comes from the indexing of layers, I conclude that the correct value is 29523. The value of the expression is computed by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus three times the previous layer. Starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer, which is three times the second layer. The final result is 29523. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{29523}$<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, let's call it Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2 is 3(1 + Layer 1). So, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 would be 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miss a layer. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, right? Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. So, if I have nine layers, then Layer 1 is the innermost, and Layer 9 is the outermost. So, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1).  <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is the outermost layer, which is the entire expression. Therefore, the value should be 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait a second, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Hmm, 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300 + 120 = 420 +24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444)=3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200 + 120=1320 +15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335)=3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: <nEwLiNe>1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. <nEwLiNe>So, 3000 + 900=3900 +90=3990 +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008)=3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000 +27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027)=3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3: <nEwLiNe>10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. <nEwLiNe>So, 30000 + 6000=36000 +84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after verifying each step, it seems that the final result is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help compute this without having to calculate each layer step by step. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined recursively as Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer n-1). This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer n-1). <nEwLiNe>With Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute the first few terms: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers, I can see that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3 times 1. Hmm, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence of the form a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 4 + 3/2 = 3*A => (8/2 + 3/2) = 3*A => 11/2 = 3*A => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but maybe it's better to factor it differently. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with the known values. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (11*243 -9)/6 = (2673 -9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (11*729 -9)/6 = (8019 -9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (11*2187 -9)/6 = (24057 -9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (11*6561 -9)/6 = (72171 -9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (11*19683 -9)/6 = (216513 -9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute it step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about this is that each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 3. So, it's a geometric series with a common ratio of 3, but with an added constant each time. <nEwLiNe>But since I already have the closed-form formula, I can just plug in n=9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

So, is the value 36084? <nEwLiNe>Let me verify that step by step, because nine layers is a lot, and it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent each time. So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me check a couple of the steps. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. 49*3 is 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24, so 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; so 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18; so 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27; so 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84; so 36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the computations. So, yeah, 36,084 is the answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have L2: 1 + 3*(result of L1). So that would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, L3: 1 + 3*(result of L2) = 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, L4: 1 + 3*(result of L3) = 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*(result of L4) = 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*(result of L5) = 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*(result of L6) = 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*(result of L7) = 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*(result of L8) = 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check my calculations because that seems like a lot, and I might have messed up somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent each time. So the final result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify once more because these numbers are getting big quickly, and I might have made a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each step again: <nEwLiNe>1. L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. L3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. L4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. L5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. L6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. 1092 +1=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. L7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279. So 3000+279=3279. 3279+1=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. L8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840. So 9000+840=9840. 9840 +1=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. L9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000 + 2523 = 29523. 29523 +1=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that seems consistent. So, the final result is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any layers or miscount the number of parentheses. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time it's 3*(1 + ...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))). How many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)): each time, it's a new layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(1 + ...), each subsequent 3(1 + ...) is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers, each corresponding to L1 to L9 as I computed earlier. So, 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 =1 + 3*a_2=1 + 39=40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's exactly what I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recurrence: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 =4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} =1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r -3=0 => r=3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A =1 => -2A=1 => A= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 -1/2 => 4 =3C -1/2 => 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result).

So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute each layer again step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Layer 10: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>So, maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Let’s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, we have a recursive sequence: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, <nEwLiNe>and so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Is there a closed-form formula for a_n? <nEwLiNe>Yes, because this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_{n+1} = c*a_n + d. <nEwLiNe>In this case, c = 3, d = 1. <nEwLiNe>The solution to such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = c^{n-1} * a_1 + d*(c^{n-1} - 1)/(c - 1). <nEwLiNe>So, plugging in c = 3, d = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3^{n-1} * 4 + (3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1). <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n-1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Combine terms: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4*3^{n-1} is equal to (8/2)*3^{n-1}, right? <nEwLiNe>So, 4*3^{n-1} = (8*3^{n-1})/2. <nEwLiNe>Then, (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1} - 1)/2 = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (9*3^{n-1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But let's check this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (9*3^{0} - 1)/2 = (9*1 - 1)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (9*3^{1} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (9*9 -1)/2= (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (9*3^{8} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (9*6561 - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9*6561: 6561*9. Let's compute 6561*10=65610, subtract 6561: 65610 - 6561=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, 9*6561=59049. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the formula, we get the same result, which is reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a geometric series with a multiplier of 3 each time. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, both methods give the same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each set of parentheses starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So that would be 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to multiply the outermost layer by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems a bit large. Let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72, carryover 7. <nEwLiNe>24 becomes 72, so 2*3=6, plus 7 is 13. Wait, no, wait. Let's do it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Actually, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. So, 3*29,524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 29,524 * 3 is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, my final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me think again. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the process seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer is following a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, solving this recurrence relation, perhaps? <nEwLiNe>Let me see. The recurrence is linear: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. <nEwLiNe>First, solve homogeneous: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the equation: C = 3*C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, general solution: a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Use initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's interesting. So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, how many layers do we have? Let's count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer adds one more. So, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each opening parenthesis adds a layer, starting from (1 + 3). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each step adds a layer. The innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Then, each time you go out, you add another layer. So, in the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, if you count the number of (1 + 3(...)), it's 9 times. So, Layer 1 is the innermost, Layer 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation for Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to write a general formula, the total expression is 3*( (3^{n} - 1)/2 ), where n is the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, n is 9, so 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144 / 2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, another way to think about it is that the entire expression simplifies to (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Either way, it's 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with the recurrence relation, and confirming with the general formula, I can confidently say the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let's call this layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's call this layer 2. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. Layer 3. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Layer 4. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Layer 5. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Layer 6. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Layer 7. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Layer 8. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 9, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). Because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something), where something is 1 + 3*(...). So, in my layers above, layer 9 is the result of the innermost expression, and each subsequent layer is built by wrapping 1 + 3*(previous). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my previous calculation, layer 9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*layer 8. So, the outermost is 3*(layer 9). So, the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the layers are actually 8, not 9, because starting from the innermost, each 3*(1 + ...). Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial assumption of 9 layers is incorrect. Let me try to parse the expression again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3( is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 3(, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer. So, let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers of 3(. So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier calculation, I started with a₁ = 1 + 3, then a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁, up to a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈. <nEwLiNe>But in that case, the outermost expression is 3*a₉, which is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the layers are 8, because starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is the first layer, and then each 3*(... adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think in terms of the number of multiplications by 3. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is multiplied by 3 once, except the outermost which is multiplied by 3 as well. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need a different approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*a₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*a₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*a₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*a₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is defined as aₙ = 1 + 3*aₙ₋₁, starting from a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, then, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me check if this is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for aₙ. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation: aₙ = 1 + 3*aₙ₋₁, with a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is aₙ = A*3ⁿ + C, where C is a constant. <nEwLiNe>To find C, we can use the steady-state solution. Let’s assume aₙ = C for all n. Then, substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is aₙ = A*3ⁿ - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a₁ = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3¹ - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is aₙ = (3/2)*3ⁿ - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify once more because I might have miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...), so layer 2, up to layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a₉ = 29524, and the total expression is 3*a₉ = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let me compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I double-checked using both iterative computation and the recurrence relation formula, and both gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each level is following a recurrence relation.

Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the innermost expression as A1, then the next one as A2, and so on, until A9, since there are 9 layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>A1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, A2 = 1 + 3*A1. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, A3 = 1 + 3*A2, and so on, until A9. <nEwLiNe>So, essentially, each A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1). <nEwLiNe>That seems like a recursive sequence.

Therefore, A(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Since the original expression is 3*(A9), because the outermost operation is 3*(...), and A9 is the result of the innermost expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me make sure: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...*(1 + 3)))). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3)=4, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous, and the outermost operation is 3*(A9). Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression is 3*(A9). Wait, actually, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer adds a 3*(...). So, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, actually, the expression is 3*(A9), where A9 = 1 + 3*(A8), and so on. Wait, no, actually, A1 is the innermost (1 + 3) =4, then A2 = 1 + 3*A1, which is 1 + 3*4=13, and so on, until A9=1 + 3*A8. <nEwLiNe>But then the entire expression is 3*A9, right? Because the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, the entire value is 3*A9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I computed A9 as 29524, so the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4, then moving out, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after 9 layers, we have A9, and then the entire expression is 3*A9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier notation, A9 is already 1 + 3*A8, so the outermost operation is 3*(A9). So, the total expression is 3*A9. <nEwLiNe>So, if A9 is 29524, then 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let's verify: <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my earlier step-by-step, A9 was 29524, which is 1 + 3*A8, where A8 was 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, A9=1 + 3*9841=1 + 29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*A9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula, A(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, A9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3*A9=3*(29524)=88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check the computation: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>Adding up: 60000 +27000=87000; 87000 +1500=88500; 88500 +60=88560; 88560 +12=88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on, I think I might have miscounted the number of layers. Let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, from the first 3, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), but each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)), so actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, and then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, leading to A9=29524, and then the entire expression is 3*A9=88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify by computing the number of multiplications. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of the expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if I have n layers, the value would be (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, the entire expression is 3*(...), so perhaps it's 3*( (3^{n} -1)/2 ). Wait, no, because the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my initial approach was correct. Let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3) =4. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, until after 8 more layers, we get to A9=29524. Then, the outermost operation is 3*A9=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me see, if I have 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each adding another layer, then the total expression is 3*(A9). So, yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 4, each step is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the sequence is 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. <nEwLiNe>Each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, it's a geometric progression with ratio 3, but offset by 1 each time. <nEwLiNe>The formula we derived earlier was A(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, A(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*A(9)=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step manually: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost operation is 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. So, starting from 4, each step is 3*previous +1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, no: the recurrence is A(n) = 1 + 3*A(n-1). So, it's not 3*previous +1, but rather 1 + 3*previous. So, it's the same as A(n) = 3*A(n-1) +1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a different way to write the same recurrence. So, it's a linear recurrence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. <nEwLiNe>The solution we found earlier was A(n) = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, which satisfies A(n) = 3*A(n-1) +1. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify with n=1: A(1)=4. Using the formula: (3^2 -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: A(2)=13. Formula: (3^3 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A(9)=29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. So, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>We define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Let \(A_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>- Each subsequent layer is defined by \(A_n = 1 + 3 \cdot A_{n-1}\). <nEwLiNe>We compute the first few terms to identify a pattern: <nEwLiNe>- \(A_1 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_3 = 1 + 3 \cdot 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_4 = 1 + 3 \cdot 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_5 = 1 + 3 \cdot 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_6 = 1 + 3 \cdot 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_7 = 1 + 3 \cdot 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_8 = 1 + 3 \cdot 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>- \(A_9 = 1 + 3 \cdot 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>We recognize this as a linear recurrence relation \(A(n) = 1 + 3 \cdot A(n-1)\) with the solution \(A(n) = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). For \(n = 9\), we have: <nEwLiNe>\[ A_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524 \] <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is \(3 \cdot A_9\): <nEwLiNe>\[ 3 \cdot 29524 = 88572 \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me denote each layer as Layer 1, Layer 2, up to Layer 9, starting from the innermost. So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let's try that. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084? Hmm, let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each layer is built upon the previous one, multiplying by 3 each time. So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, after 9 layers, we end up with 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, maybe I should compute the entire expression step by step without labeling the layers, to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Replace that, so the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>3. Compute the next innermost: (1 + 3*4). Wait, hold on. Is it 3*(1 + 4) or (1 + 3*4)? Wait, no. It's 3*(1 + 4). Because the structure is 3*(1 + something). So, that something is the innermost parentheses. So, it's 3*(1 + (innermost)). <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I misapplied that earlier. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should think of each step as replacing the innermost parentheses first. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me parse this expression correctly. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one. So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each time replacing the innermost with its value. <nEwLiNe>So, step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, same result as before. So, 36084 is the final answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each time, we're computing 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I denote each step as a term in a sequence, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, same result. So, the pattern is each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for this recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to 8/2: <nEwLiNe>8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>So, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, the term is: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 196830 + 19683 = 216513. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe better to compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 2 is 0, but 21 ÷ 6 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36 ÷ 6 = 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05 ÷ 6 = 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 0: 50 ÷ 6 = 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24 ÷ 6 = 4, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the expression evaluates to 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}.

So, after computing Layer 9, which is the outermost, that should be the final result. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, the same result as before. So, is 36084 the correct answer? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 3 each time. It seems similar to a geometric series or something like that. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider each layer: <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>Given L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write out the first few terms: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, it's consistent with my previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>But maybe I can model this recursion. <nEwLiNe>Given L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, that's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me find the particular solution. Assume L_n = K, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: K = 3 + 3K => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = (11/2)*3^{0} - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L_2 = (11/2)*3^{1} - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>L_3 = (11/2)*9 - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = (11/2)*3^{8} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/2)*6561: <nEwLiNe>First, 6561 * 11 = ? <nEwLiNe>Compute 6561*10 = 65610 <nEwLiNe>6561*1 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>Add them: 65610 + 6561 = 72171 <nEwLiNe>So, 72171 / 2 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = 36084, which matches my previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute it step by step once more. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. So, I think 36084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of each layer as multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(previous addition). But that might complicate things more. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can factor out the 3s. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>If I expand this, it's 3 + 3*3(1 + 3(1 + ... )) + 3*3*3(...) <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe that's getting too abstract. Alternatively, perhaps it's a form of a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 each time. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, the recursion is linear, so perhaps my earlier approach with the recurrence relation is the best. <nEwLiNe>Either way, whether I compute step by step or use the formula, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. There are nine sets of parentheses here, each with a 1 + 3(...). Let's go step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost one: Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So that's 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving to Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2 result). So 1 + 3*13. That's 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3 result). 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4 result). 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5 result). 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6 result). 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7 result). 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8 result). 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9 result). So that's 3*29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: 29,524 * 3. Let's do it step by step. <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the entire expression equals 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. That is, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But wait, actually, starting from a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3*K + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition: a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with my step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*( (59049 -1)/2 ) = 3*(59048/2) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I think I can be confident that the value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again, but maybe in a different way. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5.

Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result each time. So, I think that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute the entire expression by expanding it, but that might be more complicated. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, if I denote each nested expression as E_n, then E_1 = 1 + 3, E_2 = 1 + 3E_1, and so on up to E_9, and the total expression is 3*E_9. <nEwLiNe>But since we already found that E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then total expression is 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confirm that the value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me recompute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 =15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, adding 29,524 three times: <nEwLiNe>29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048. <nEwLiNe>59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the computation is correct. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 1, which is similar to a geometric progression but with an added constant. The closed-form formula we derived earlier helps in computing it without having to go through each layer step by step, which is especially useful if the number of layers were larger. <nEwLiNe>So, in summary, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let's compute 12028*3: 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 20*3=60, 8*3=24; adding up: 30000+6000=36000+60=36060+24=36084. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>So, according to my step-by-step calculation, the value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me see if there's a pattern here or a formula that could have given me the same result without computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation, right? So, if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer(n), that might be quicker. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general form is Layer(n) = 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), with Layer(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1) + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, because 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)) = 3 + 3*Layer(n-1). So, yes, it's Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The standard method is to solve the homogeneous part and then find a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous recurrence is Layer(n) = 3*Layer(n-1), which has the solution Layer(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2A = 3 <nEwLiNe>A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is Layer(n) = C*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition Layer(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to 8/2, so 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Thus, C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Layer(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11/6)*3^n <nEwLiNe>And 3/2 is just subtracted. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can write Layer(n) = (11*3^{n-1} ) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>= (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) <nEwLiNe>= (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, maybe that's another way to express it. <nEwLiNe>But let me test it with n=1: <nEwLiNe>Layer(1) = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer(2) = (11*3^2 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer(3) = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, since the original problem is Layer(9), let's compute Layer(9): <nEwLiNe>Layer(9) = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = Let's compute 10*19683 = 196,830 and 1*19683 = 19,683. Adding them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36. 6 goes into 36 six times. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05. 6 goes into 5 zero times, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 0: 50. 6 goes into 50 eight times (8*6=48), remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24. 6 goes into 24 four times. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer(9) = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my step-by-step calculation earlier. So that's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>Define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 1}) = 3(1 + 4) = 15\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 2}) = 3(1 + 15) = 48\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 3}) = 3(1 + 48) = 147\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 4}) = 3(1 + 147) = 444\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 5}) = 3(1 + 444) = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 6}) = 3(1 + 1335) = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 7}) = 3(1 + 4008) = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: \(3(1 + \text{Layer 8}) = 3(1 + 12027) = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me denote each layer as Level 1, Level 2, up to Level 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, let me count them. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Level 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result from Level 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, maybe I can compute each level step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each level: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing up to Level 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times (something). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Hmm, let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Looking again: the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if I compute the innermost parentheses first, then work my way out, each time replacing the innermost with its value, I can compute each level step by step. <nEwLiNe>So, let's structure this: <nEwLiNe>Start from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9). Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Level 9. Wait, no, actually, Level 9 was the innermost, so when we worked outwards, each Level n is computed based on Level n-1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I got confused with the numbering. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the next one is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc., up to the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, is the outermost 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost expression? <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking at the structure: <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Then, the entire expression is 3*(result of the 9th layer). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

So, that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, if Layer 9 is 29524, then 3*29524 is the result. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in the Layer 9 computation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Layer 8 was 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3.

So, each layer is a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check this formula with the first few layers. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct, Layer 1 is 4. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct, Layer 2 is 13. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40. Correct, Layer 3 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Good, the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer 9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches the previous computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.

Step 2. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 39 = 40. Step 3. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 120 = 121. Step 4. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 4) = 1 + 363 = 364. Step 5. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Step 6. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Step 7. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Step 8. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(Step 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Step 9. <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the outermost operation is 3*(Step 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that step by step. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000. <nEwLiNe>Then, 9000 * 3 = 27000. <nEwLiNe>Then, 500 * 3 = 1500. <nEwLiNe>Then, 20 * 3 = 60. <nEwLiNe>Then, 4 * 3 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems to be correct. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because the numbers are getting large quickly. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe recognizing a pattern or a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recursions. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}. In this case, c=1, r=3. <nEwLiNe>The solution for such a recurrence is a_n = r^n * a_0 + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recall the formula. For a linear recurrence relation a_n = r*a_{n-1} + c, the solution is a_n = (a_0)*r^n + c*(r^n - 1)/(r - 1). <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's right. <nEwLiNe>In our case, a_0 is the initial term, which is the innermost expression, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, etc. So, actually, the recurrence starts at a_1 = 4, and each subsequent term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, how many terms do we have? Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of layers: Each ""1 +"" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's one layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each time we have 3*(...), so each opening parenthesis adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each time we have a (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) sections. <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers before the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. <nEwLiNe>The innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each time we go out, we add another layer. So, the first layer is 1 + 3, then the second is 1 + 3*(first), third is 1 + 3*(second), etc. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside that, there are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, inside the first 3*, there's 1 + 3*(...). Inside that, another 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until we get to the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>How many 1 + 3*(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(1) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(2) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(3) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(4) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(5) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(6) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(7) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(8) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*(9) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Maybe it's better to count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting after the first 3, each layer is a (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the 9th layer, because from the outside, the first layer is 3*(...), then inside that is the second layer, and so on, until the ninth layer is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers do we have? From the expression, each ""1 + 3("" adds a new layer, so from the innermost (1 + 3) up to the outermost, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer adds one. So, layer 2 is 1 + 3*(layer 1). <nEwLiNe>Continuing until layer 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), and then the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the expression is 3*(a_9), where a_9 is the result of 9 layers of 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute a_9, we can use the formula for linear recurrence relations. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can express this as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1}, which has the solution a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 1 <nEwLiNe>K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. Therefore, the value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the recurrence, it's 3*a_9, where a_9 is (3^{10} - 1)/2, so 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that also gives the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost expression: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, we multiply the result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\[3 \times 29524 = 88572\]. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me check the original expression. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So yes, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. <nEwLiNe>So, let me formalize this. Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is computed as 1 + 3*previous term. So, starting from the innermost, which is 4, then each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous term). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost term is (1 + 3). So, that is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(result of previous layer), and so on, until we get to the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: each ""3("" is a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) - 1 layer <nEwLiNe>2. Then, each subsequent 3( adds another layer. So, let's count how many times 3( appears after the initial one. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>I can see that starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3(, so let's count the number of 3( after the initial one. <nEwLiNe>First layer: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times ""3("" appears. Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))...). So, the first 3 is followed by 9 more 3(, right? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 3(. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's count the number of opening parentheses. The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each time a new ( is opened, and that corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of (: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3( is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>- Then, each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each ""3("" after the first one is a new layer. So, how many are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: after the first 3, each 3( is a new layer. Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times ...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me count how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's see. The innermost is Layer1, then Layer2, up to Layer9, because each 3( adds a layer, and starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check: the innermost is Layer1, then each time we go out, it's another layer. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. So, actually, there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure. Let's count the number of closing parentheses: each ) corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each set of parentheses adds one more layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3( appears, which is 9 times after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the initial 3( is the first layer, then each 3( inside is a new layer. So, the total number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive expression with 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the layers: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote L1, L2, ..., L9 as the results of each layer from the innermost to the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is L9, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, let me clarify. The initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, if L9 is the result of the innermost expression, then the entire expression is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier notation, L1 was the innermost, which was 4, and each subsequent L was built by 1 + 3*L_previous. So, if I have L9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I haven't miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's recount. The innermost is (1 + 3), which is L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*L_prev. <nEwLiNe>So, the layers are: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, L9 is the result of the innermost expression up to the 9th layer. Then, the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000, so 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500, so 87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60, so 88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, so 88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with nested expressions, it's easy to miscount the layers or miscompute the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize a pattern or a formula for such recursive expressions. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A => A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition: L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation. So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be thorough, let me compute 3*29524 step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break down 29524 into 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3 as: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>x    3 <nEwLiNe>------ <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, that's the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully computing each layer step by step, verifying with a closed-form formula, and double-checking the multiplication, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88572.

Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Let’s call the innermost parentheses Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>- Then Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2). <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, we multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems quite a large number, and I might have made an error in one of the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me go through each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, +12 = 1092. Then 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, +9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000. 87000 + 1500 = 88500. 88500 + 60 = 88560. 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions instead of computing each layer manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. <nEwLiNe>This expression resembles a geometric series or a recursive sequence. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form: Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). Starting from Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation: Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer n-1, with Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>I know that such recurrence relations can often be solved using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 3*Layer n-1 + 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a first-order linear recurrence. The homogeneous part is Layer n = 3*Layer n-1, which has the solution Layer n = C*3^n, where C is a constant. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say Layer n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is Layer n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition: Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2 = (3^(2+1) -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 = (3^5 -1)/2= (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 = (3^(9+1) -1)/2 = (3^10 -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 =27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 =59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since Layer n = (3^(n+1) -1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*(3^10 -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*(3^10 -1)/2 = (3^11 -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^11: <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. So, that confirms the answer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

The entire expression is \(3 \times \text{Layer 9}\), which is \(3 \times 29524\). <nEwLiNe>4. Using the formula for the nth layer, we find that Layer 9 is \((3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>5.

Let me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, Layer 2 would be: 1 + 3*(Layer 1 result).

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524*3 again. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12. Write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7.

So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 layers of nesting, right? <nEwLiNe>Looking back: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Yes, each time it's 3*(1 + ...), so starting from the innermost (1+3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, 9 layers in total. So, Layer 9 is the outermost, and then multiplied by 3, which is the initial 3 outside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the calculation seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that aligns with my previous calculation. So, seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence. Let me recall that for a linear recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c, the solution can be found using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. <nEwLiNe>In this case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) + 1 <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B + 1 = A*3^n + 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>So, equating LHS and RHS: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = A*3^n + 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms the result using a different method, the recurrence relation formula. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute this using the formula directly without computing each layer. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's pretty solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both the iterative layer-by-layer approach and the recurrence relation formula give the same result. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Continue this process for each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. The result of the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. Multiply this by 3: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
