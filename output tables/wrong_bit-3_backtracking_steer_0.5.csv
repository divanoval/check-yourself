Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected prefix: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go.

Let me define each level starting from the innermost as level 1. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, that's level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So, Level 2 = 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Level 9 result) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*29524. Let me do that multiplication step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Level 1: <nEwLiNe>1. Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Final result: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, all the intermediate steps seem correct. Each level is just 1 plus three times the previous level. So, the process is consistent. Maybe there's another way to represent this to see if the result makes sense. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write out the terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>And then the final result is 3*a_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution would be based on the characteristic equation r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p <nEwLiNe>Solving: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the explicit formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with the known terms. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the explicit formula works for all these cases. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire expression in terms of the formula, the original expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049, 3^{11}=177147. <nEwLiNe>So, 3^{11} = 177147. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step, use the recursive formula, or apply the explicit formula, I get the same answer: 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that solidifies the result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost level: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>4. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next level: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, we compute the outermost layer: \(3 \times 29524 = 88572\). <nEwLiNe>Thus, the computed value is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm numbering the layers correctly. The original expression has nine layers, right? Each ""1 +"" is a new layer. So starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then each step outward is the next layer. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 15, Layer3 as 48, Layer4 as 147, Layer5 as 444, Layer6 as 1335, Layer7 as 4008, Layer8 as 12027, and Layer9 as 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. Hmm, but let me verify each step to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, seems consistent each time. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, is there a pattern here? Let me think. Each time, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive formula. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to model this recursion. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n >= 2. <nEwLiNe>So, let's write out the first few terms: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, same results as before. So, if I can model this recursion, perhaps I can find a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recursion: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous and particular solutions. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence as: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The associated homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Homogeneous solution: C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>Given a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, plug n=1 into the general solution: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can factor 3^n: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check that: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^n - 9)/6 = (11/6)*3^n - 9/6 = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, which matches. <nEwLiNe>So, with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683: Let's compute that step by step. <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 196830 + 19683 = 216513. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504. <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, 3*6=18, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36. 6 into 36 is 6, 6*6=36, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05. 6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 0: 50. 6 into 50 is 8, 8*6=48, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24. 6 into 24 is 4, 4*6=24, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be thorough, let me verify the division: <nEwLiNe>6 * 36084 = ? <nEwLiNe>Compute 6 * 36000 = 216000 <nEwLiNe>6 * 84 = 504 <nEwLiNe>Add them: 216000 + 504 = 216504. Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 216504 ÷ 6 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see the pattern another way. Each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3, so the sequence is 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4 to 15: 4*3 + 3 = 15. <nEwLiNe>15*3 + 3 = 48. <nEwLiNe>48*3 + 3 = 147. <nEwLiNe>147*3 + 3 = 444. <nEwLiNe>444*3 + 3 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>1335*3 + 3 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>4008*3 + 3 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>12027*3 + 3 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, consistent each time. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, thinking about the expression, it's similar to a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), so maybe we can write the entire expression as a sum. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). <nEwLiNe>So, it's like a nested multiplication, each time adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric series but nested. Maybe it's a form of a geometric progression with each term being multiplied by 3 each time. <nEwLiNe>But I think the recursion approach is more straightforward here. <nEwLiNe>So, in conclusion, after computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2.

The general solution for this recurrence relation is found to be: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>a_n = \frac{11 \cdot 3^n - 9}{6} <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 9\): <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = \frac{11 \cdot 3^9 - 9}{6} = \frac{11 \cdot 19683 - 9}{6} = \frac{216504}{6} = 36084 <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me assign each set of parentheses a level. So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, Level 2 is: 1 + 3*(Level 1 result). So that would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Level 2 result is 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out to Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2 result) = 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Level 3 result is 40. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3 result) = 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>That's 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 4 result is 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4 result) = 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 5 result is 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5 result) = 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 6 result is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6 result) = 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 7 result is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7 result) = 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>That would be 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 8 result is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8 result) = 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Compute: 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Level 9 result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check if I've counted the levels correctly. The original expression has multiple layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many levels there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" starts a new level. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 levels of nesting. That means I need to compute from Level 1 up to Level 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, in my earlier calculation, I went up to Level 9, getting 29524. But let me verify each step because it's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the result of the innermost expression is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*(that result). Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, actually, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed Level 9, I already considered that the outermost Level 9 is 1 + 3*(Level 8). So, does that mean that the entire expression is just Level 9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, that's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something), where something is the entire nested expression starting from the first (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier breakdown, I labeled Level 1 as the innermost (1 + 3), and Level 9 as the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), which is then multiplied by the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, Level 1 is innermost, and each subsequent Level is one layer out. So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9 result). So, Level 9 result is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would make the total result 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier computation, I thought Level 9 was the outermost. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(something), and the something is (1 + 3*(...)). So, the something is Level 1 through Level 8, and the outermost is Level 9: 3*(Level 8 result). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my earlier approach was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps each Level is one more layer. So, let me try a different approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me define: <nEwLiNe>Let a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(a9). Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in my definitions, a1 is the innermost, and a9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me check the structure: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression evaluates to 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure that I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 layers of nesting, each starting with ""3("", so after computing 9 layers, I get 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is the outermost operation already included in Layer 9? Let me parse the expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a layer, so the first ""3("" is the outermost, and the last ""3("" is the innermost. So, actually, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after 9 layers, the innermost is a1 = 4, then a2 = 13, a3 = 40, a4 = 121, a5 = 364, a6 = 1093, a7 = 3280, a8 = 9841, a9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(a9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought that a9 was already the result of the innermost expression, so 3*(a9) is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I need to think of it differently. Let's consider how many times 3 is being multiplied. <nEwLiNe>Each layer adds another multiplication by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplied by 3 and added 1. <nEwLiNe>It's similar to a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps there's a formula for such expressions. <nEwLiNe>In general, expressions of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} can be represented as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me test with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a1 = (3^1 - 1)/2 = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but wait, a1 is 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We have a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition a1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this with n=1: a1 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a3=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, so the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n layers, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the inner expression evaluates to 29524, and the entire original expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me compute 3^10: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to compute it, but given the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result, I can be confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. Use this result to compute the next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. The result of the innermost expression after 9 layers is 29524. The entire expression is then: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me assign each set of parentheses a level. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(Level 1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each level is 3*(1 + next level). Hmm, maybe it's better to work from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm counting the levels correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 levels. So, yes, I think I did 9 levels, from Level 1 to Level 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial breakdown, I labeled Level 1 as the innermost, which is correct. Then each subsequent level wraps around the previous one. So, Level 2 is 3*(1 + Level 1), Level 3 is 3*(1 + Level 2), and so on until Level 9. <nEwLiNe>So, following that: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but considering each step multiplies by 3 and adds 3 each time, it's exponential growth. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Let me compute 1336*3: 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3. 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27. So 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Compute 12,028*3: 12,000*3=36,000, 28*3=84. So 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, seems like each step is correct. So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each level is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solve for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2*K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*C - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor 3: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3*(11*3^{n-2} - 1))/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, not sure if that's helpful. <nEwLiNe>But anyway, the formula is a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, wait: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^3 is 27, so 11*27 = 297. <nEwLiNe>297 - 3 = 294. <nEwLiNe>294 / 2 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 10*6561 = 65,610. <nEwLiNe>Then add 6561: 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. Which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me verify 11*6561: <nEwLiNe>Compute 6561 * 10 = 65,610. <nEwLiNe>Compute 6561 * 1 = 6,561. <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 65,610 + 6,561. <nEwLiNe>65,610 + 6,000 = 71,610. <nEwLiNe>71,610 + 561 = 72,171. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2. <nEwLiNe>72,000 / 2 = 36,000. <nEwLiNe>168 / 2 = 84. <nEwLiNe>So, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the answer. It was a bit tedious with all the parentheses, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with a formula helped solidify the result. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, up to E9 or something, depending on how many layers there are. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the left, there are 9 opening parentheses, so probably 9 layers. Let me check: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Yes, each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...), so 9 layers. So, E1 is the innermost, and E9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, E2 is: 1 + 3*E1. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, E3 is: 1 + 3*E2, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, En = 1 + 3*E(n-1), starting from E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, E1 is the innermost, so maybe I should index them differently. Let me think. Let me assign E1 as the innermost, so: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards: <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2. <nEwLiNe>And so on, until E9, which would be the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>But actually, looking at the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(...), so maybe I need to adjust. Let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, perhaps each En is 3*(1 + En-1). Hmm, no, that can't be because the innermost is just (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4), then the next is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 4)), etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should model this as a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me try: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is built from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, up to a9. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(...), which would be 3*a8, because a9 would be the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to adjust my indexing. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: the innermost expression is (1 + 3) = 4. Let's call that a1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Let's call that a2. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. a3 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Then, a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, not adding 1. So, maybe my a1 is the innermost, and each subsequent a is built by adding 1 and multiplying by 3, but the outermost is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me write the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the entire expression is Layer9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this step by step because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be thorough, let me compute it another way, maybe using a formula for such recursive expressions. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is defined by En = 3*(1 + En-1), starting from E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, E1 is 4, E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 15, E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 48, etc. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for En. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is En = 3*(1 + En-1), with E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as En = 3*En-1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: En - 3*En-1 = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say En = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is En = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check for n=1: E1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (33/6) - (9/6) = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, n=2: E2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, the expression has 9 layers, so we need E9. <nEwLiNe>Compute E9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>First, compute 3^9. <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Then, E9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5*11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches our step-by-step computation earlier. So, the value is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost.

Finally, the outermost layer: 3*A9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. But let me verify each step carefully because with so many layers, it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A1: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364.

Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>A8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So 9000+600=9600+240=9840.

Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. It's similar to a geometric series, but not exactly because each term is nested inside the next. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me consider the structure: it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>This resembles the form of a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3. Let's see if we can model it that way. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's exactly what we computed earlier. So the expression is a recursive sequence where each term is built from the previous one. <nEwLiNe>In fact, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it using the method for such recursions. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>To solve this, we can find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is linear and can be written as: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution will have a homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, how many layers do we have in the original expression? <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing, each additional layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, how many times does the pattern ""1 + 3("" occur? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(, then another 1 + 3(, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, let's count the number of 1 + 3( layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of ""1 + 3("" sections: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing, each additional layer adds another 1 + 3(. <nEwLiNe>From the expression, starting after the first 3(, each layer is 1 + 3(, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(. <nEwLiNe>So, the expression is built as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 40. <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the number of layers is 9, right? Because starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each corresponding to each set of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence relation, a_n corresponds to the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our earlier computation, we had a_1 = 4, a_2 =13, a_3=40,... up to a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the original expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Which is 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). <nEwLiNe>Wait, because in the closed-form solution, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the original expression is 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>3^{11} = 177147. <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144 / 2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, using the closed-form expression, we also get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, regardless of the method, the result is consistent. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is to recognize that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost value of 4. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, since the expression is built with 9 layers inside the outermost multiplication by 3, it's equivalent to 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). <nEwLiNe>So, 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 -1 = 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me define each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>- ... <nEwLiNe>- Up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking at the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Hmm, starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). That seems like 9 layers? Wait, no, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent 3(...) adds a layer. Let me count the number of 3(...): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, actually, starting from the first one, each time we have another 3(...), so total layers are 9? Or 8? Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of ""1 + 3("" parts. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each time we have ""1 + 3("" until the outermost. Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" segments. <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it as: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 3(1 + Layer8) <nEwLiNe>So, total of 9 layers? Or maybe 8? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, we have 9 layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's 8 layers? Because starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3(...). Let me try to count the number of 3s. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I can see 9 instances of 3 multiplied by a parentheses. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is multiplied by 3. So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not. Let me parse the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3 * (1 + 3)))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a multiplication by 3 outside. So, starting from the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, how many such layers? Let's count the number of 3*(...): starting from the innermost, each layer adds one. So, starting with (1 + 3), then 3*(1 + ...), so that's 1 layer. Then another 3*(1 + ...), that's 2 layers, etc., until the outermost. So, in total, how many 3*(...) are there? Let's count. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each 3*(1 + ... is a layer. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 9 layers? So, the innermost is layer 9: (1 + 3). Then layer 8 is 3*(1 + layer9), layer7 is 3*(1 + layer8), and so on up to layer1, which is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems a bit confusing, but perhaps it's 9 layers. So, perhaps I should compute starting from layer9 inward. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the outermost layer is Layer1, which equals 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems quite large, but let me verify the computations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer9: (1 + 3) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Hmm, 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; total 300+120=420 +24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; total 1200+120=1320 +15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18; total 3000+900=3900 +90=3990 +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27; total 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Compute 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84; total 36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure I didn't miscount the layers. Let me count how many layers I computed: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1:36084 <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers in total. So, starting from the innermost (Layer9) as (1 + 3), and building up each layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(1 + ...). So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. So, L_9 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n+1}) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, since each layer is built from the previous one. Wait, perhaps it's better to define it as L_{k} = 3*(1 + L_{k-1}), starting from L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, let me think about the direction. Since we start from the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4, which is L9. <nEwLiNe>Then, L8 = 3*(1 + L9) <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + L8) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>L1 = 3*(1 + L2) <nEwLiNe>So, in terms of recurrence, it's L_{k} = 3*(1 + L_{k-1}), starting from L9 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if we index from k=9 down to k=1, then it's a bit non-standard. Alternatively, we can reverse the order and define it as starting from k=1 to k=9, but with L1 being the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a sequence where each term is defined based on the next term. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps I can write it as: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + next term), starting from the innermost term which is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, term1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>term2 = 3*(1 + term1) <nEwLiNe>term3 = 3*(1 + term2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>term9 = 3*(1 + term8) <nEwLiNe>So, term9 is the outermost term, which is 3*(1 + term8). Wait, no, actually, term1 is the innermost, term9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is term1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, term2 = 3*(1 + term1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>term3 = 3*(1 + term2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to term9 = 3*(1 + term8) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so term9 is the outermost layer, which is the value we need. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric progression or use a formula for such a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Each term is defined as L_{k} = 3*(1 + L_{k-1}), starting from L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can write this recurrence as: <nEwLiNe>L_{k} = 3 + 3*L_{k-1} <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_k = A*3^k + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me find the particular solution. Assume L_k = C is a constant solution. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving: C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a fractional value, but our terms are integers. Maybe this approach isn't the best, or perhaps we can use another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can write the recurrence as L_k - 3*L_{k-1} = 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is L^{(h)}_k = D*3^k <nEwLiNe>The particular solution can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the equation: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_k = D*3^k - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. When k=1, L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = D*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3D - 1.5 => 3D = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => D = 5.5 / 3 ≈ 1.8333... <nEwLiNe>But this results in fractional D, which is a bit messy, but perhaps we can write it as fractions. <nEwLiNe>5.5 is 11/2, so D = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^k = (11/6)*(3^k) = (11*3^{k}) / 6 = (11*3^{k-1}) / 2 <nEwLiNe>So, L_k = (11*3^{k-1}) / 2 - 3/2 = [11*3^{k-1} - 3] / 2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L_k = (11*3^{k-1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's test this formula with k=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=2: L2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=3: L3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=4: L4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=5: L5 = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=6: L6 = (11*729 - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=7: L7 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=8: L8 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>k=9: L9 = (11*19683 - 3)/2 = (216513 - 3)/2 = 216510/2 = 108255. Wait, but earlier we had L9 as 36084. Hmm, that's conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I might have misapplied the formula. Because in our earlier step-by-step computation, L9 was the outermost layer, which was 36084, but according to the formula, L9 is 108255. That suggests an inconsistency. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, I think I messed up the indexing. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>In the expression, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, which is Layer9, then Layer8 is 3*(1 + Layer9), up to Layer1, which is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>But in the formula, I defined L_k as starting from k=1 as the innermost, so L1=4, L2=15, ..., L9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the formula, L_k = (11*3^{k-1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for k=9, L9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Yes! So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, earlier when I computed k=9 as 108255, that was incorrect because I thought 3^{9} is 19683, but actually, for k=9, it's 3^{8} because k starts at 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, yes, because L_k = (11*3^{k-1} - 3)/2, so for k=9, it's 3^{8}=6561, so 11*6561=72171, minus 3 is 72168, divided by 2 is 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't use the formula, but just computed each layer step by step, as I did earlier, I also got 36084, so that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost. Let's see, each time there's a (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3) = 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So each time, I compute the innermost parentheses, then substitute it into the next layer, and so on. Let me verify each step. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 3). Wait, hold on, after substituting the innermost, the next parentheses is 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, no. Let me look back at the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So maybe I misapplied step 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, let me re-examine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial breakdown was incorrect. Let me parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, actually, each step is 3*(1 + result of the next innermost layer). So, let's process it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, but the original expression only has 8 layers, right? Let me count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Total, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent layer is another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" is a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 8 layers of 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer up to 8 layers. So, total layers: 8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I did my initial breakdown, I ended up with 9 layers. Hmm, seems like confusion between layers and operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to clarify: the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3), then each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. So, starting from (1 + 3), that's layer 1. Then 3*(1 + layer1) is layer2, and so on, up to layer8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I should have 8 layers. So, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my earlier count, the original expression has 8 layers of 3*(...). So, the final result should be 12027? Hmm, but let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me write the entire expression with layer numbers: <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 12027. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify this with another approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula here. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With L_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, we can write: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that's 8 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is there a closed-form formula for this kind of recurrence relation? <nEwLiNe>Yes, this is a linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>Given L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}), with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3*C - 3/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>L_3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=8: <nEwLiNe>L_8 = (11*3^{7} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^7: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*2187 = ? <nEwLiNe>11*2000 = 22000 <nEwLiNe>11*187 = 2057 <nEwLiNe>So, total: 22000 + 2057 = 24057 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L_8 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with my step-by-step calculation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 12027. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 12027. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is a geometric series, but given the recurrence relation we solved, it's clear that the formula is L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, computing for n=8 gives 12027. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, I'm confident that the result is 12027. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{12027}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(3(1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(3(1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>4.

So, starting with 3 times (something), and that something is 1 + 3*(something else), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is E1=4, then E2=13, E3=40, E4=121, E5=364, E6=1093, E7=3280, E8=9841, E9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or some recursive formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the pattern: <nEwLiNe>Each E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1). <nEwLiNe>So, E1=4, E2=13, E3=40, etc. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>In general, for such a recurrence, E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b. <nEwLiNe>Here, a=3 and b=1. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is E(n) = C*a^n + (b/(a-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. <nEwLiNe>For a recurrence relation of the form E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b, the solution is E(n) = a^n * E(0) + (b/(a - 1))*(a^n - 1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, more precisely, if E(n) = a*E(n-1) + b, then the solution is E(n) = a^n * E(0) + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). <nEwLiNe>But in our case, E1 = 4, which would be E(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, if we consider E(0) as the term before E1, which would be? <nEwLiNe>Wait, if E1 = 1 + 3*E0, but in our case, E1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to model it with n layers. <nEwLiNe>We have 9 layers here, from E1 to E9. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of multiplications by 3 is 9. <nEwLiNe>But let me try to model this. <nEwLiNe>Given E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n-1), with E(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, E(2) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to E(9). <nEwLiNe>So, the general formula for such a recurrence is E(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me test this. <nEwLiNe>If E(n) = (3^{n} - 1)/2, then for n=1, E(1) = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, but our E1 is 4, so that doesn't match. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial condition is different. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Testing for n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches E1=4. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, which matches E2=13. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, which matches E3=40. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, E(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to double-check, let me compute 3^{10} = 59049. <nEwLiNe>Then, (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ). <nEwLiNe>So, 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I computed it step by step, then verified with the general formula for the recurrence relation, and also by expressing the entire expression in terms of exponents, which gave the same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I feel confident that the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2.

The entire expression is \(3 \times E_9\): <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me number the parentheses from the innermost to the outermost.

Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. Each time, I replace the innermost part with the computed value and then compute the next layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*188329404) = 3*(1 + 564988212) = 3*564988213 = 1694964639 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3, adding 3* something, but let me see if there's a pattern here. Each time, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous_layer). Let me see if I can find a formula for this. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))))). So, it's a nested multiplication where each term is 3 times (1 + 3*...). This looks similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3, but let me check. <nEwLiNe>Suppose I let x be the innermost expression, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, it's recursive. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation.

So, the outermost is layer 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe a better approach is to see how many times we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3*(1 + 3*(...)) in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3*(1 + 3*(...))"" is a layer. So, starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), that's layer 1. Then inside that, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)), layer 2, and so on until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis starts a new layer. So, in the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), each subsequent opening parenthesis adds a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)), there are 8 more opening parentheses. So, total layers are 9. Therefore, the innermost is layer 9, and the outermost is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should think of it as layer 1 being the outermost, layer 2 being the next, down to layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, layer 1: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>layer 9: 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer n is defined as 3*(1 + 3*layer(n+1)). With layer 9 being 3*(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from layer 9: <nEwLiNe>layer9 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, earlier I thought the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, but actually, in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is multiplied by 3 in the layer above. So, layer9 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the innermost was (1 + 3) = 4, but actually, according to the expression, the innermost is 3*(1 + 3). So, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, it's multiplied by 3 in the next layer: 3*(1 + 3). So, layer1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*layer1) = 3*(1 + 3*12) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is different from my initial approach. So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier by considering the innermost as (1 + 3) instead of 3*(1 + 3). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the layer above is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, as I initially thought. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39, then the next is 3*(1 + 3*39) = 354, and so on. <nEwLiNe>But the confusion arises because depending on how you parse it, is the innermost (1 + 3) or 3*(1 + 3). But in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), because each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial approach was correct: innermost is 4, then layer2 is 39, layer3 is 354, etc., up to layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I counted the layers earlier, I thought layer9 was 188329404, but let me confirm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recast it: <nEwLiNe>Let me define each a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 36) = 3*37 = 111 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 333) = 3*334 = 1002 <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier results. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. Let me get back to the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, let's parse it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*(39)) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*188329404) = 3*(1 + 564988212) = 3*564988213 = 1694964639 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step computation, the value is 1,694,964,639. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I considered a_1 as 3*(1 + 3) = 12, and then a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 111, which is different. So, I think the confusion arises from whether we start counting layers from the innermost or the outermost. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous). So, if we have n layers, starting from (1 + 3), we have n-1 multiplications by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider the number of times we apply the operation 3*(1 + 3*...). Let me think recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers.

So, is f(9) equal to the original expression? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Because in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be f(1) if we start from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to adjust the definition. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_{k} = 3*(1 + 3*a_{k-1}), starting from a_0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try that. <nEwLiNe>If a_0 = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 3*(1 + 3*a_0) = 3*(1 + 3*1) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1) = 3*(1 + 36) = 111 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2) = 3*(1 + 333) = 1002 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 3*a_3) = 3*(1 + 3006) = 9018 + 3?

So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the initial computation again: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 354 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*188329404) = 3*(1 + 564988212) = 3*564988213 = 1,694,964,639 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step, the result is 1,694,964,639. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence relation starting from a_0 = 1, I get a_9 = 532,703,172. <nEwLiNe>So, there is a discrepancy here. Therefore, my initial approach was perhaps wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, why is that? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>In the first approach, I started from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous).

So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis after the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)) adds another layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3*(...)): 8. <nEwLiNe>So, total layers: 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is layer 9, up to the outermost layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in my first approach, I computed layer1 to layer9, starting from (1 + 3) = 4, up to the outermost layer, which gave me 1,694,964,639. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I defined a_0 = 1, then a_1 = 12, which would correspond to the innermost layer if we have 9 layers, but it's conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps in the second approach, a_9 corresponds to the innermost layer, but in reality, the innermost layer is (1 + 3), which is 4, not 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indexing. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider the expression: <nEwLiNe>E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me denote E as the entire expression. Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*E'), where E' is the next nested expression. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, E' is similar to E but with one less layer. However, since all layers are similar, perhaps I can find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is similar, so maybe I can express E in terms of itself. <nEwLiNe>But since it's finite, with 9 layers, it's not an infinite series, so perhaps that approach won't work. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can observe that each layer is 3*(1 + 3*previous), so if I denote the innermost as a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + 3*a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + 3*a_2), etc., up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in this case, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 39, a_3 = 354, ..., a_9 = 1,694,964,639. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the original expression is a_9, which is 1,694,964,639. <nEwLiNe>But to confirm, let me try to compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's only 9 layers, but in the original expression, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers inside.

Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer1) = 3(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer2) = 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3(1 + Layer3) = 3(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me check that again. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost, Layer1 is 4. Then Layer2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Layer4 is 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Layer5 is 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Layer6 is 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Layer7 is 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Layer8 is 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Layer9 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me write it step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems quite large, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3, because 3*(1 + x) = 3 + 3x. So, each layer is 3 + 3 times the previous layer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, a_1 is 4, which is from (1 + 3). Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which matches. So, yes, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>We can rewrite this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*C = 3 <nEwLiNe>C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. We have a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*A - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*A <nEwLiNe>A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2) <nEwLiNe>We can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but perhaps it's better to compute it directly. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our case, n starts at 1 with a_1 = 4. So, let's compute a_9 because we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Thus, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute: <nEwLiNe>3280.5 * 10 = 32805 <nEwLiNe>3280.5 * 1 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Total: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me retrace the steps: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Multiply by 3: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's nine layers, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1. So, the final result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I had to write this as a sum, maybe there's a pattern or a formula, but given that each step is a linear operation, the recurrence seems the most straightforward way. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is 3 times the previous plus 3, so it's a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then an additional 3 is added. <nEwLiNe>But since we already solved the recurrence, and it gave us 36,084, which matches our manual computation, I think that's solid. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}.

So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps around that. <nEwLiNe>So, let me try to compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in the layers. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1+3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is 3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 is 3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 is 3*(1 +147)=444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 is 3*(1 +444)=1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 is 3*(1 +1335)=4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 is 3*(1 +4008)=12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 is 3*(1 +12027)=36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each layer is computed as 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is there a pattern here? Let me see the sequence: <nEwLiNe>4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the multipliers: 4 is 4, then 15 is 4*3 + 3, 48 is 15*3 + 3, 147 is 48*3 + 3, etc. So each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Hmm, that seems like a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can find a general formula for this recurrence. Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>and a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a first-order linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the equation: <nEwLiNe>a_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute this for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 =15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>So, the value at layer n is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, we have 9 layers, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 /6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 *11 = let's compute: <nEwLiNe>3280.5 *10 = 32805 <nEwLiNe>3280.5 *1 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Total = 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2 = 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 -1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me recompute step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 +4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5:3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step is correct, so I can be confident the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, E3, etc., starting from the innermost. So, E1 is the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, E2 would be 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. The structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, actually, maybe E2 is 3*(1 + E1). So, if E1 is 4, then E2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer, E3 would be 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the layers. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + ... occurs. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... starting from the left. Each opening parenthesis introduces another layer. So, starting from the first 3, there are 9 layers, right? Because each ""1 + 3(..."" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: Each 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...), so the number of layers is equal to the number of 3s. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each 3 is the start of a new layer. So, how many 3s are there? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the left, the first 3 is layer 1, then each subsequent 3 is a new layer.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; 1200+120=1320+15=1335.

So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers to compute. So, my calculation from layer 9 to layer 1 is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such expressions? It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is of the form a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we can write a recurrence relation: a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>If we have a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution: a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2 => 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) /6 = (11*3^{n-1}) /2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: a_1 = (11*3^{0} -3)/2 = (11 -3)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (11*3^{1} -3)/2 = (33 -3)/2=30/2=15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3=(11*9 -3)/2=(99-3)/2=96/2=48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11*27 -3)/2=(297-3)/2=294/2=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*6561 -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: 10*6561=65610, 1*6561=6561, so total is 65610+6561=72171. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3: 72171 -3=72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 /2=36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, I think that's the correct answer. Both methods, step by step computation and solving the recurrence relation, give me the same result, so I feel confident. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

To be thorough, let me compute it again, just to make sure I didn't miscalculate any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. So I think I can confidently say the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a way to represent this expression in a more general form? Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear recurrences. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c is a constant and r is the common ratio. <nEwLiNe>In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. <nEwLiNe>The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (c/(1 - r)) + (a_0)*r^n, but wait, actually, the homogeneous solution and particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recall. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = B. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>B - 3*B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. Let's see, when n=1, a_1 = 1 + 3*(innermost 1 + 3). Wait, actually, in our original problem, the innermost layer is (1 + 3) = 4, which would correspond to a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indexing. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression has 9 layers of nesting. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, total layers are 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the first operation, and then each time you go out, you add another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is one layer, and then each time you wrap it with 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, from the first 3, then each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, there are 9 instances of ""1 + 3("" before the last closing parenthesis. So, that suggests 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, n = 9. <nEwLiNe>So, in the recurrence, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc., up to a_9, which is 29524, and then the total expression is 3*a_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the recurrence solution: <nEwLiNe>We have a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>We know that a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, plug in n=1: 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to get the same result, using the recurrence relation and solving it. That gives me more confidence that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a way to see this as a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). It's a bit tricky because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, it's not a straightforward geometric series, but rather a nested multiplication. <nEwLiNe>But as we saw, the recurrence approach works well here. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the layers are: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Total expression: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, I think I've confirmed it multiple times. Each step seems correct, and the recurrence relation approach also leads to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Let’s say Layer 1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until Layer 9, since there are nine layers. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. But the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>- 9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12. Write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15. Write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>Finally, there's a 2 at the beginning (since 29524 is 2 9 5 2 4). So, 2 * 3 = 6. Since there's no carryover, write 6. <nEwLiNe>So putting it all together: 6, 8, 8, 7, 5, 2. Wait, that would be 688752? Wait, no, let me write it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 is: <nEwLiNe>Digits: 2 (ten thousands), 9 (thousands), 5 (hundreds), 2 (tens), 4 (units). <nEwLiNe>Multiplying by 3: <nEwLiNe>- Units: 4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- Tens: 2*3=6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>- Hundreds:5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- Thousands:9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- Ten thousands:2*3=6 +2=8, write 8, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 8 (ten thousands), 8 (thousands), 7 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 2 (units). Wait, that would be 88752? But 29524 *3=88572? Wait, hold on, maybe I messed up the placement. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let me compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 +1=7, write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5 *3=15, write 5, carryover1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572? Wait, that can't be because 29,524 *3 is 88,572. Wait, but 29,524 *3: 29,524 +29,524=59,048; 59,048 +29,524=88,572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check if my Layers are correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from Layer1: 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1+3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1+3*13=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1+3*40=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1+3*121=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1+3*364=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1+3*1093=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1+3*3280=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1+3*9841=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 3: 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, is that the final answer? Let me check my computations again because sometimes with so many layers, it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:1+3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=1+12=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=1+39=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1 +3*40=1+120=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 +3*121=1+363=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So Layer9 is 29524, and then multiplied by 3 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify if I have 9 layers. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1+"" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1+3) <nEwLiNe>Then each layer wraps around: 1+3(...). So how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1+3(...)"" sections. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1+3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1+3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1+3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 1+3( ... ). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), and each layer adds another 1+3(...). <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is another (1+3(...)). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1+3) <nEwLiNe>Layer2: (1+3(Layer1)) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: (1+3(Layer2)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: because starting from Layer1, we have 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers. So Layer9 is 29524, multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check my multiplication again just to be sure. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 20,000 *3=60,000. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9,000*3=27,000. <nEwLiNe>Compute 500*3=1,500. <nEwLiNe>Compute 20*3=60. <nEwLiNe>Compute 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>So, 60,000 +27,000=87,000. <nEwLiNe>87,000 +1,500=88,500. <nEwLiNe>88,500 +60=88,560. <nEwLiNe>88,560 +12=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can compute the expression step by step using another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can notice that this expression is a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, looking at the structure: Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a recurrence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we can write: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>a_3=1 +3*a2=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>a_4=1 +3*a3=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>a_5=1 +3*a4=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>a_6=1 +3*a5=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7=1 +3*a6=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8=1 +3*a7=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9=1 +3*a8=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, same result as before. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, which can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant. <nEwLiNe>To find C, we can use the steady-state solution. <nEwLiNe>Assume a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Then, C = 1 + 3*C => C -3*C=1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a1=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2=9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9= (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our previous computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3*a9=3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms it. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 3*a9=3*(3^{10}-1)/2= (3^{11}-3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 -3)/2=177144/2=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to ensure, let me compute 3^{11}. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11=177147 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3^{11}=177,147. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3: 177,147 -3=177,144. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2:177,144 /2=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, verifying with a recurrence relation, and then even finding a closed-form formula to compute the result, I can confidently say the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me assign each set of parentheses a level. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me verify that. Each level is 1 + 3*(previous level). So starting from Level 1 as 4, Level 2 would be 1 + 3*4 = 13, right? Then Level 3 is 1 + 3*13 = 40. Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So is Level 9 the innermost, and then we have to multiply the outermost 3 by Level 9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, except for the outermost 3(.... So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). There are 8 layers of 1 + 3*(...) before we get to the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of times 1 + 3*(...). Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>But the outermost is 3*(Level 9). So the total expression is 3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 + 29524 + 29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524: 59048. <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524: 59048 + 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me add 59048 + 20000 = 79048. <nEwLiNe>79048 + 9524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm again because I might have miscounted the levels. Let me count the number of nested parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is one pair. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds another pair. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Total number of (1 + 3(...) layers: from the innermost to the outermost, how many? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...1)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...2)) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(...3)) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(...4)) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(...5)) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(...6)) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(...7)) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(...8)) <nEwLiNe>10. (1 + 3(...9)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) is the innermost, level 1. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(level1) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(level2) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(level3) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(level4) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(level5) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(level6) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(level7) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(level8) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*(level9) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the outermost is 3*(...). So in total, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of closing parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the end: <nEwLiNe>1. ) <nEwLiNe>2. ) <nEwLiNe>3. ) <nEwLiNe>4. ) <nEwLiNe>5. ) <nEwLiNe>6. ) <nEwLiNe>7. ) <nEwLiNe>8. ) <nEwLiNe>9. ) <nEwLiNe>10. ) <nEwLiNe>Wait, 10 closing parentheses? But the outermost is just one closing parenthesis after the last 1 + 3(...). Wait, no, each layer has its own closing parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each (1 + 3) is a separate layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3), which is level 1. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer wraps around: <nEwLiNe>- Level 2: 1 + 3*(level1) <nEwLiNe>- Level 3: 1 + 3*(level2) <nEwLiNe>- Level 4: 1 + 3*(level3) <nEwLiNe>- Level 5: 1 + 3*(level4) <nEwLiNe>- Level 6: 1 + 3*(level5) <nEwLiNe>- Level 7: 1 + 3*(level6) <nEwLiNe>- Level 8: 1 + 3*(level7) <nEwLiNe>- Level 9: 1 + 3*(level8) <nEwLiNe>- Level 10: 1 + 3*(level9) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...). So the outermost is 3*(Level10). So maybe I miscounted earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is level1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is another level. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times do we have ""1 + 3(...)""? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 (level1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 (level2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 (level3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 (level4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 (level5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 (level6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 (level7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 (level8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 (level9) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573 (level10) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after level9, we have another layer, level10, which is 1 + 3*(level9). Then the outermost is 3*(level10). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would make the computation as follows: <nEwLiNe>Compute level1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>level2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>level3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>level4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>level5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>level6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>level7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>level8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>level9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>level10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(level10) = 3*88573 = ? <nEwLiNe>Compute 88573 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me calculate: <nEwLiNe>3 * 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3 * 7 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 88573 is the number. Let me write it down: <nEwLiNe>88573 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>3 * 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But wait, there are no more digits, so we write the carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 88573 is a 5-digit number: 8 8 5 7 3 <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>3 * 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3 * 7 = 21, write 1, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 * 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, write 7, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 * 8 = 24 + 2 = 26, write 6, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But since we're at the leftmost digit, we just add the carryover 2 in front. <nEwLiNe>So the result is 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>88573 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Compute 80000 * 3 = 240000 <nEwLiNe>8000 * 3 = 24000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>70 * 3 = 210 <nEwLiNe>3 * 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>Add them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000 <nEwLiNe>264000 + 1500 = 265500 <nEwLiNe>265500 + 210 = 265710 <nEwLiNe>265710 + 9 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 3*(level10) = 3*88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought the innermost was level1, and the outermost was level9. Now, I'm getting confused. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does ""1 + 3("" appear? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 3(... <nEwLiNe>Then inside, it's 1 + 3(...), which is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then inside that, another 1 + 3(...), which is the second layer. <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9. Each ""1 + 3("" adds one. So, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I counted earlier, I got 10 layers because I started counting from the innermost. Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I should think of each ""1 + 3(...)"" as a recursive step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, if I have n layers, the expression would be 3*(1 + 3*(...)) with n layers. <nEwLiNe>In this case, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 1 layer. Then each subsequent layer wraps around. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have ""1 + 3("" in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, starting from 3(1 + 3(...)), how many ""1 + 3("" are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>10. ...1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, the number of ""1 + 3("" is 9, because each layer after the first 3 adds another ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>So, layers 1 to 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous layer).

Let me define each layer starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, and so on up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that because the original expression has nine layers, right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). So, counting the number of times the pattern starts with 3(...), I think there are nine 3s multiplied, each time with a new layer. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me parse the expression correctly. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + 3 times the next layer). So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So perhaps the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that would mean Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 13, Layer 3: 40, Layer 4: 121, Layer 5: 364, Layer 6: 1093, Layer 7: 3280, Layer 8: 9841, Layer 9: 29524. So the total expression is Layer 9, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, no, wait. Let me look again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So if Layer 9 is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't seem right because when I computed Layer 9, I thought it was 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 29524, but then the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, actually, my previous computation might have been wrong because I might have considered Layer 9 as the outermost, but in reality, the outermost is 3*(Layer 9). Hmm, I'm getting confused now. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify. Let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>The innermost parentheses is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is that the final answer? Let me check each step again. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3. Let's compute 30,000 * 3 = 90,000. Then subtract (476 * 3) because 30,000 - 476 = 29,524. So 476*3=1,428. So 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm with another approach. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, if we denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, etc. So the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C. Then substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems fractional, but our initial terms are integers. Maybe that's okay because the homogeneous solution will take care of the integer part. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, the innermost layer is n=1, corresponding to (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer increases n by 1. Since there are 9 layers, the outermost layer is n=9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the entire expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, actually, no. Let's think again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*a_1 = a_2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing up to Layer 9: a_9. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, so is the outermost operation 3 multiplied by a_9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, indeed, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9). Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, then a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that's consistent with my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3. But since each layer is built on the previous one, the closed-form formula seems more straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step numerically again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I might have computed each layer step by step, but since I noticed the recurrence relation, the closed-form formula made it much easier, especially for a larger number of layers. <nEwLiNe>So, in conclusion, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}.

So, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, maybe I need to compute starting from the innermost and work outward, each time replacing the innermost with its value. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each step: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote L1, L2, L3,..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Compute L1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Wait, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). Wait, maybe I misapplied. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, moving outward: <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems like a big jump. Let me verify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try to write down each step clearly. <nEwLiNe>Let’s write the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(previous layer)). <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L2 = 3*(1 + 3*L1) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*L2) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*L3) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*L4) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*L5) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258,339. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*L6) = 3*(1 + 3*258,339) = 3*(1 + 775,017) = 3*775,018 = 2,325,054. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*L7) = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054) = 3*(1 + 6,975,162) = 3*6,975,163 = 20,925,489. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*L8) = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489) = 3*(1 + 62,776,467) = 3*62,776,468 = 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final result is 188,329,404? <nEwLiNe>But let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2 = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + 3*3189). Let's compute 3*3189: 3000*3=9000, 189*3=567, so total is 9000 + 567 = 9567. Then 1 + 9567 = 9568. 3*9568: 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 60*3=180, 8*3=24. So, 27000 + 1500 = 28500, +180=28680, +24=28704. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + 3*28704). Compute 3*28704: 28,704*3. Let's compute 20,000*3=60,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 700*3=2,100, 4*3=12. So, 60,000 +24,000=84,000 +2,100=86,100 +12=86,112. Then, 1 +86,112=86,113. Multiply by 3: 86,113*3. 80,000*3=240,000, 6,000*3=18,000, 100*3=300, 13*3=39. So, 240,000 +18,000=258,000 +300=258,300 +39=258,339. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + 3*258,339). Compute 3*258,339: 200,000*3=600,000, 50,000*3=150,000, 8,000*3=24,000, 300*3=900, 39*3=117. So, 600,000 +150,000=750,000 +24,000=774,000 +900=774,900 +117=775,017. Then, 1 +775,017=775,018. Multiply by 3: 775,018*3. 700,000*3=2,100,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 18*3=54. So, 2,100,000 +210,000=2,310,000 +15,000=2,325,000 +54=2,325,054. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + 3*2,325,054). Compute 3*2,325,054: 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 300,000*3=900,000, 25,000*3=75,000, 54*3=162. So, 6,000,000 +900,000=6,900,000 +75,000=6,975,000 +162=6,975,162. Then, 1 +6,975,162=6,975,163. Multiply by 3: 6,975,163*3. 6,000,000*3=18,000,000, 900,000*3=2,700,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 5,000*3=15,000, 163*3=489. So, 18,000,000 +2,700,000=20,700,000 +210,000=20,910,000 +15,000=20,925,000 +489=20,925,489. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + 3*20,925,489). Compute 3*20,925,489: 20,000,000*3=60,000,000, 900,000*3=2,700,000, 25,000*3=75,000, 489*3=1,467. So, 60,000,000 +2,700,000=62,700,000 +75,000=62,775,000 +1,467=62,776,467. Then, 1 +62,776,467=62,776,468. Multiply by 3: 62,776,468*3. Let's compute 60,000,000*3=180,000,000, 2,000,000*3=6,000,000, 700,000*3=2,100,000, 70,000*3=210,000, 6,000*3=18,000, 400*3=1,200, 68*3=204.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I messed up the digit places. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should write it as: <nEwLiNe>62,776,468 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Compute 62,776,468 * 3: <nEwLiNe>62,776,468 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>------------ <nEwLiNe>= (60,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 700,000 + 70,000 + 6,000 + 400 + 60 + 8) *3 <nEwLiNe>= 180,000,000 + 6,000,000 + 2,100,000 + 210,000 + 18,000 + 1,200 + 180 + 24 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>180,000,000 <nEwLiNe>+6,000,000 = 186,000,000 <nEwLiNe>+2,100,000 = 188,100,000 <nEwLiNe>+210,000 = 188,310,000 <nEwLiNe>+18,000 = 188,328,000 <nEwLiNe>+1,200 = 188,329,200 <nEwLiNe>+180 = 188,329,380 <nEwLiNe>+24 = 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 62,776,468 *3=188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L9=188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check each step because that's a huge number, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>From L1 to L9: <nEwLiNe>L1: 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + 12)=39 <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + 117)=354 <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + 1062)=3189 <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + 9567)=28704 <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + 86112)=258,339 <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + 775,017)=2,325,054 <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + 6,975,162)=20,925,489 <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + 62,776,467)=188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Each step seems correct, so I think the final answer is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, because computing 9 layers manually is error-prone. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: each layer is defined by L_{n} = 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let's write it as: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 9*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Because 3*(1 + 3*L_{n-1}) = 3 + 9*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is L_n = 9*L_{n-1} + 3, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*9^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: L_n - 9*L_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 9 = 0, so r=9. So, homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*9^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_n^{(p)} = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 9*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 9C = 3 <nEwLiNe>-8C = 3 <nEwLiNe>C = -3/8 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = A*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, n=1 corresponds to L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*9^1 - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>4 = 9A - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/8 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/8 = 9A <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to eighths: 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8 <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>35/8 = 9A <nEwLiNe>Thus, <nEwLiNe>A = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(35/72)*9^n = (35/72)*(9^n) = (35/72)*(9^n) <nEwLiNe>Note that 9^n = 9*81^{n-1}, but perhaps better to write it as (35/8)*(9^{n-1})*(9/9) ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, note that 35/72 can be simplified as 35/(8*9). Hmm, not sure. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's compute L_n for n=9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, since n starts at 1, and we have 9 layers, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Compute 9^9: <nEwLiNe>9^1=9 <nEwLiNe>9^2=81 <nEwLiNe>9^3=729 <nEwLiNe>9^4=6561 <nEwLiNe>9^5=59049 <nEwLiNe>9^6=531441 <nEwLiNe>9^7=4782969 <nEwLiNe>9^8=43046721 <nEwLiNe>9^9=387420489 <nEwLiNe>So, 9^9=387,420,489. <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (35/72)*387,420,489 - 3/8. <nEwLiNe>Compute (35/72)*387,420,489: <nEwLiNe>First, 387,420,489 divided by 72. <nEwLiNe>Compute 387,420,489 /72: <nEwLiNe>Well, 72 * 5,000,000 = 360,000,000. <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489. <nEwLiNe>Now, 72 * 380,000 = 27,360,000. <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489. <nEwLiNe>72 * 839 = 60,408. <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 60,489 -60,408=81. <nEwLiNe>72 *1=72. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:81 -72=9. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 +839 +1=5,380,840 with a remainder of 9. <nEwLiNe>So, 387,420,489 /72 =5,380,840 with a remainder of 9, so approximately 5,380,840 + 9/72=5,380,840.125. <nEwLiNe>But since we're multiplying by 35, let's compute 35*(387,420,489 /72). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, compute 35*(387,420,489)/72. <nEwLiNe>Compute numerator:35*387,420,489. <nEwLiNe>Compute 35*387,420,489: <nEwLiNe>First, 30*387,420,489=11,622,614,670. <nEwLiNe>Then, 5*387,420,489=1,937,102,445. <nEwLiNe>Add them together:11,622,614,670 +1,937,102,445=13,559,717,115. <nEwLiNe>So, 35*387,420,489=13,559,717,115. <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 72: <nEwLiNe>13,559,717,115 /72. <nEwLiNe>Compute 72*180,000,000=12,960,000,000. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:13,559,717,115 -12,960,000,000=599,717,115. <nEwLiNe>72*8,000,000=576,000,000. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:599,717,115 -576,000,000=23,717,115. <nEwLiNe>72*300,000=21,600,000. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:23,717,115 -21,600,000=2,117,115. <nEwLiNe>72*29,400=2,116,800. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:2,117,115 -2,116,800=315. <nEwLiNe>72*4=288. <nEwLiNe>Subtract:315 -288=27. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 180,000,000 +8,000,000 +300,000 +29,400 +4=188,329,404 with a remainder of27. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 13,559,717,115 /72=188,329,404 with a remainder of27. <nEwLiNe>So, 35/72 *387,420,489=188,329,404 +27/72=188,329,404.375. <nEwLiNe>Then, L_9 =188,329,404.375 - 3/8. <nEwLiNe>Convert 3/8 to decimal: 0.375. <nEwLiNe>So, 188,329,404.375 -0.375=188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>So, L_9=188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, both methods give the same result. So, the answer is indeed 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>I think that solidifies the result. So, after computing each layer step by step and then verifying using a recurrence relation, I'm confident that the result is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{188329404}.

Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting the layers: Each ""1 +"" is a new layer, so starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3). Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1). Then Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2), and so on, up to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times...))). So there are 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, to compute this, I need to start from the innermost and work outwards. <nEwLiNe>So, let's define each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Right. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yep. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Hmm, 1336*3: 1336*3 is 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12,000; 9*3=27; so total is 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let's compute 12,028*3: 12,000*3=36,000; 28*3=84; so total is 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer seems to compute correctly. Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can try a different approach or see if there's a pattern or formula that can help compute this without going step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 3 each time. Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each Layer n is defined as 3*(1 + Layer n-1). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with Layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>This seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I denote a_n as the value at layer n, then: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, let's try to find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence is linear and can be expressed as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Yes, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution: a_n^{(p)} = K <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Therefore, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify this expression: <nEwLiNe>Note that 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, so: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works for the first few layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, the value is: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (11*19,683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19,683: <nEwLiNe>First, 10*19,683 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1*19,683 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). By working from the innermost layer outward, we computed each step carefully and verified with a general formula derived from the recurrence relation. Both methods led us to the same result, so I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me define each level starting from the innermost. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>- Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>- Level 2: 3(1 + Level 1) <nEwLiNe>- Level 3: 3(1 + Level 2) <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until Level 9. <nEwLiNe>So, Level 1 is 4. Then Level 2 is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving on to Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, Level 3 is 48. Now, Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Level 4 is 147. Next, Level 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Level 5 is 444. Level 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Level 6 is 1335. Level 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Level 7 is 4008. Level 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Level 8 is 12027.
