Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected prefix: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside:
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.
Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.
Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.
Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.
Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.
Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.
Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.

Wait, that seems huge. Let me check my calculations again because 36084 seems too big. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps. <nEwLiNe>Let me go through each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so each time I'm multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(1). It's like a geometric progression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It seems similar to a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. The expression is of the form: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))) <nEwLiNe>Each time, it's 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I let x be the innermost term, then x = 1 + 3, but actually, each term is built upon the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Wait, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial step-by-step, a_2 was 15, but if I use a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. But that contradicts my earlier step where I got 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Maybe the way I'm defining a_n is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... )))) with 8 sets of parentheses. So, actually, there are 9 layers if you count the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" adds a layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers. So, my initial step-by-step was correct, going from layer 1 to layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, and then layer 2 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but if I think of it as a recurrence relation, perhaps a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, with a_1 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, that seems too large, and I feel like there's a formula to compute this without expanding all the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. Each term is defined by a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>3*A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factoring out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>11*6561: 10*6561 = 65,610; 1*6561 = 6,561; so total is 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Then, 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me verify with n=1. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Which is what I had earlier. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost expression is \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Using this result, we compute each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 2: \(3(1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 3: \(3(1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 4: \(3(1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 5: \(3(1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 6: \(3(1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 7: \(3(1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 8: \(3(1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 9: \(3(1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>To verify, we solve the recurrence relation \(a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1})\) with \(a_1 = 4\). The general solution is found to be \(a_n = \frac{11 \cdot 3^{n-1} - 3}{2}\). For \(n = 9\): <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = \frac{11 \cdot 3^8 - 3}{2} = \frac{11 \cdot 6561 - 3}{2} = \frac{72171 - 3}{2} = \frac{72168}{2} = 36084 <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final result is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Wait, hold on, that seems really big. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check each step again. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the value is 36084. Hmm, but let me think again if that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, maybe there's a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow a certain progression. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 4, then 15, then 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers, each term is 3 times the previous term plus something? <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4 to 15: 4*3 + 3 = 15. <nEwLiNe>15*3 + 3 = 48? Wait, 15*3 is 45, plus 3 is 48. Hmm, yes. <nEwLiNe>48*3 + 3 = 147? 48*3 is 144, plus 3 is 147. <nEwLiNe>147*3 + 3 = 444? 147*3 is 441, plus 3 is 444. <nEwLiNe>444*3 + 3 = 1335? 444*3 is 1332, plus 3 is 1335. <nEwLiNe>1335*3 + 3 = 4008? 1335*3 is 4005, plus 3 is 4008. <nEwLiNe>4008*3 + 3 = 12027? 4008*3 is 12024, plus 3 is 12027. <nEwLiNe>12027*3 + 3 = 36084? 12027*3 is 36081, plus 3 is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. Interesting. So, if I model this as a recurrence relation, maybe I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n as the value at each layer. So, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, looking back, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Which can be rewritten as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say A. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 3/2: a_n = (3/2)*(11/3)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. Hmm, maybe not necessary. <nEwLiNe>But let's check for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - (3/2) = (8/2) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = (90/6) = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = (288/6) = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to work. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, which is our case, since we have 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5 *11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me confirm once more to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 9 layers, so n=9, so a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute it, but since both step-by-step and the recurrence solution give the same result, I'm confident it's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Wait, so after computing each layer, the result is as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that.

Each layer seems to be multiplying by 3 and then adding 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>From 4 to 15: 4*3 + 3 = 15. <nEwLiNe>From 15 to 48: 15*3 + 3 = 48. <nEwLiNe>From 48 to 147: 48*3 + 3 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so each time, it's multiplying by 3 and adding 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from 4, each term is 3*(previous term + 1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Term n = 3*(Term n-1 + 1) <nEwLiNe>So, starting with Term 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Term 2 = 3*(4 + 1) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Term 3 = 3*(15 + 1) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Term 4 = 3*(48 + 1) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Term 5 = 3*(147 + 1) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Term 6 = 3*(444 + 1) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Term 7 = 3*(1335 + 1) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Term 8 = 3*(4008 + 1) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Term 9 = 3*(12027 + 1) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, that seems to be the pattern. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term. <nEwLiNe>Given that each term is defined by Term(n) = 3*(Term(n-1) + 1), with Term(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write out the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>Term(n) = 3*Term(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: Term(n) - 3*Term(n-1) = 3. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: Term(n) - 3*Term(n-1) = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is Term_h(n) = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say Term_p(n) = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is Term(n) = Term_h(n) + Term_p(n) = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition: Term(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>Term(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2. <nEwLiNe>So, Term(n) = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, Term(n) = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this for n=1: <nEwLiNe>Term(1) = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>Term(2) = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>Term(3) = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, Term(9) = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, Term(9) = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: <nEwLiNe>First, 10*6561 = 65,610. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1*6561 = 6,561. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, Term(9) = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(previous result + 1). So: <nEwLiNe>1. 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(4 + 1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(15 + 1) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(48 + 1) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(147 + 1) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(444 + 1) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1335 + 1) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(4008 + 1) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(12027 + 1) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's nine layers, and each step is correct. So, the final answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the closed-form formula, it's (11*3^{8} - 3)/2 = (72,171 - 3)/2 = 72,168/2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods confirm the same result. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I considered the step-by-step expansion, noticed a pattern, derived a recurrence relation, solved it to find a closed-form formula, and verified both methods give the same result. Therefore, I'm confident that the value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out.

Wait, that seems like a lot of layers. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I don't want to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Compute from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Finally: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, each step seems to be multiplying by 3 after adding 1. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, this looks similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me think about the recurrence: Let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, the innermost is 4, then each subsequent term is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147, <nEwLiNe>and so on. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence can be written as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution would be the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution: a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Now, since we have 9 layers, n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683 = 19683*10 + 19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, indeed, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step computation was correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have recognized the pattern earlier, but since I was unsure, I did it step by step.

Wait, hold on, that seems way too big. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the layers. Let me check again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So how many layers are there? Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Let me count the number of 3s. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each outer layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So how many 3s are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 9 opening parentheses, so 9 layers? Wait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, each layer is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the number of layers is 9. Let me confirm. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Yes, each time we have 3*(1 + ...), and each ... is another 3*(1 + ...). So the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct? Let me verify step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again. Each time, we're computing 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from 4, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3. Wait, no: 3*(1 + previous) is equal to 3 + 3*previous. So, each term is 3 + 3*previous term. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from 4: <nEwLiNe>Next term: 3 + 3*4 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*15 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*48 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*147 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*444 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*1335 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*4008 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3 + 3*12027 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 36084 is the result after 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for this kind of recursive multiplication. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each step is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution is B. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: B = 3 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, B - 3*B = 3 => -2*B = 3 => B = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2 => 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>But let me compute for n=9. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our step-by-step computation. So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Wait, hold on. That seems like a lot, but let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so according to this, the value is 36084. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. (Yes, 148*3 is 444.) <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. (445*3 is 1335.) <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. (1336*3: 1300*3=3900, 36*3=108; total 4008.) <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27; total 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84; total 36084. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that seems consistent. So, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: there are 9 sets. So, each layer is one of these. So, starting from the innermost, we have Layer 1 to Layer 9. So, the computation is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think. Each time, it's 3*(1 + previous term). So, if we denote each term as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no. Wait, in our earlier computation, Layer 1 was 4, then Layer 2 was 15, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not. Let me think of it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, the general formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so this is a linear recurrence. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, let's find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), let's assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n})/6. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/6: a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Yes, because 3/2 = 9/6. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Now, let's compute a_9. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: 10*19683=196830, 1*19683=19683; total 196830 + 19683 = 216513. <nEwLiNe>Then, 216513 - 9 = 216504. <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36000 = 216000. <nEwLiNe>216504 - 216000 = 504. <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier result.

Wait, hold on, so each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me verify these calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.

Let me think about this. <nEwLiNe>The expression is a repeated application of multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time. Wait, no, actually, each time it's 3*(1 + previous). So, it's like a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a geometric series?

Wait, so after computing all layers, the final result is 36084? Hmm, let me verify that because the numbers are getting pretty big, and I might have made a mistake in counting the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted how many layers there are. Let me check again. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's Layer 1, then each subsequent multiplication by 3 adds another layer. Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression starts with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So how many times does 3(1 + ... occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe another approach: Each ""3("" adds a new layer, so let me count how many times ""3("" appears. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3( starts the expression. <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, another 3( starts. <nEwLiNe>- Then another, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's 9 layers because each time you have a 3(1 + ... and each time, it's nested 8 more times? Wait, maybe I should count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can think of it as 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) with a certain number of terms. Let me try expanding each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer up to Layer 9, the result is 36084. Let me check if that's correct by computing each step again. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer's result). So, after 9 layers, starting from 4, we get to 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the number of layers. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a new layer, so from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 adds another layer.

So that means 9 layers. So, starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3), then up to Layer 9 as the outermost. So, yes, 36084 is the correct result after 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula I can use to compute this without expanding each layer, just to confirm. It seems like each layer is a recurrence relation where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n >= 2. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, perhaps I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation is linear, so maybe I can solve it using standard techniques. Let's write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, it's a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Add 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3*A => 11/2 = 3*A => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check this for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - (9/6) = (33/6) - (9/6) = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Let's compute using the formula: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Formula: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - (9/6) = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, seems the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Now, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5, then 3280.5 * 11. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. So, the expression evaluates to 36084. The expression evaluates to 36084 after expanding each nested layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Explanation:** <nEwLiNe>1. **Identify the Structure:** <nEwLiNe>   The given expression is a nested recurrence where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer outward. <nEwLiNe>2. **Compute Each Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 1:** 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 2:** 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 3:** 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 4:** 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 5:** 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 6:** 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 7:** 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 8:** 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 9:** 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>3. **Verification Using Recurrence Relation:** <nEwLiNe>   The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 with a_1 = 4. Solving this gives a closed-form solution a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. For n=9, this results in 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Wait, so is the answer 36084? Hmm, that seems quite large. Let me verify my steps. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, each time, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3*(1 + previous result). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous). That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the expression starting at each layer as a_n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation can be written as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>To find C, set a_n = A*3^n + C. Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + C = 3 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + C). <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>3 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*C = 3 + A*3^n + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>So, set equal: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + C = 3 + A*3^n + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>C = 3 + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n layers, the result is (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, we have 9 layers. So, n=9. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/2)*3^{8} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/2)*6561: <nEwLiNe>First, 6561 * 11 = let's compute 6561*10=65610, plus 6561=72171. <nEwLiNe>Then, 72171 / 2 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. So, that's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, how many layers is that? Let's count the number of 3(1 + ...). Each 3(1 + ... is a layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3(1 + ... is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, each 3(1 + ... is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with the first 3, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3(1 + ... is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, another 3(1 + ... is layer 2. <nEwLiNe>- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1, then each wrapping 3(1 + ... adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, how many 3(1 + are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + ...: that's the first layer. <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3(1 + ...: that's the second layer. <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 3(1 + ... until we reach the innermost (1 + 3). So, starting from the outermost, each 3( adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>From the expression, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with 3(1 +, then inside that, another 3(1 +, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3(1 + are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the number of opening parentheses after each 3(1 +: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each time we have a 3(1 +, which is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 1 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 2 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 3 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 4 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 5 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 6 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 7 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 8 <nEwLiNe>- 3(1 + 3(...): layer 9 <nEwLiNe>- Then the innermost is (1 + 3): layer 10? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is layer 1. Then each wrapping is a higher layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, I think I'm confused. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first operation. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each 3*(1 + previous) is a layer. <nEwLiNe>So, if I have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ..., then n=9. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Number of 3(1 + ...: Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 9 <nEwLiNe>10. Then the innermost is (1 + 3): layer 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is the first term. Then each layer wraps around it. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should think of it as n layers, each time adding a 3*(1 + ... So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). <nEwLiNe>So, if there are 9 layers, each 3*(1 +, starting from (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of layers is 9, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>Given that, we have a_9 = 36084, which is what I computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>But let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with 3(1 +, then inside that, another 3(1 +, and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each 3(1 + is a new layer. Let's count the number of 3(1 +: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 9 <nEwLiNe>10. Then the innermost is (1 + 3): layer 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, it's 9 layers of 3*(1 +, plus the innermost (1 + 3). So, total layers n=10? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my previous calculation, I considered n=9 and got 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, starting from 3(1 +, and each subsequent 3(1 + adds a layer, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>From the expression, each 3(1 + is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with the first 3(1 +, each subsequent 3(1 + is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 9 <nEwLiNe>10. Then the innermost is (1 + 3): layer 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so n=10 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in my previous calculation, I considered n=9 and got 36084. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should compute a_10 instead. <nEwLiNe>Let me try. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Compute up to a_10. <nEwLiNe>Compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if n=10, then a_10=108255. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, is it n=9 or n=10? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each 3(1 + ... is a layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1=4, then a_2=15, a_3=48, ..., up to a_9=36084. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3(1 + a_8). Wait, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost layer, which is Layer 9: 3*(1 + previous layer's result). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the original expression, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then each wrapping 3*(1 + is a new layer, up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is a_9=36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought maybe n=10, but that's incorrect because the innermost is Layer 1, and each subsequent wrapping is a new layer, so the outermost is Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm once more. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(1 +, each 3(1 + is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Number of 3(1 + ...: Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 1 <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...): layer 9 <nEwLiNe>10. Then the innermost is (1 + 3): layer 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from the first 3(1 +, there are 9 layers, and the innermost is layer 10. <nEwLiNe>But in the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer wraps around it. So, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3(1 + ... which is 9, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the result is a_9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=9, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/2)*3^{8} - 3/2 = (11/2)*6561 - 1.5 = (72171)/2 - 1.5 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check my steps again because that seems like a huge number. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so the final result is 36,084? That seems big, but if each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time, it might be correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try a different approach. Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula for such recursive expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, let's write out the terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so the ninth layer, which is the outermost one, is 36,084. That seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2) = (11*3^{n-1}) - (3/2). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (8/2) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, seems accurate. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>Thus, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5, multiplied by 11 is 3280.5 * 11. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. That matches the step-by-step computation. So, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the answer. Let me just recap. <nEwLiNe>We had a nested expression with nine layers, each layer being 3*(1 + previous layer). Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). After computing each layer step by step up to the ninth layer, we arrived at 36,084. Additionally, by solving the recurrence relation, we found a closed-form formula which confirmed that the result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the given expression, we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \] <nEwLiNe>We denote each layer as \(a_n\), where \(n\) is the layer number.

Wait, so the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 12027) which is 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems huge. Let me verify if I did that correctly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 3, right? Wait, no, not exactly. It's 3*(1 + previous). So each step is 3*(1 + previous). So, it's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for this instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the nth layer as a_n. Then, the recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>with the base case a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let's write out the first few terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, that's consistent with what I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>Now, I wonder if there's a closed-form formula for a_n.

Wait, so is the final result 36084? Let me check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems correct.

When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3*A => 11/2 = 3*A => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, the formula works. So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>6561*10 = 65610, <nEwLiNe>6561*1 = 6561, <nEwLiNe>So, 65610 + 6561 = 72171. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, the final result is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result should be 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me check if I did each multiplication correctly. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. Each step, I'm adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So each layer is 3*(previous layer + 1). So, the sequence is 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Is there another way to compute this without expanding all layers? Maybe using a formula for such recursive expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. The expression is of the form: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric series but nested. Let me denote the entire expression as E. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's similar to 3 + 3*3 + 3*3^2 + ... + 3^n, but I'm not sure. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at each layer. Starting from the innermost, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_{k} = 3*(1 + a_{k-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_k = 3*a_{k-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, because 3*(1 + a_{k-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{k-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution would be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_k - 3*a_{k-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^k. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_k = C*3^k - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. At k = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_k = (11/6)*3^k - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: (11/6)*3^k = (11/6)*3^k = (11/2)*3^{k-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^k is 3*3^{k-1}, so (11/6)*3^k = (11/6)*3*3^{k-1} = (11/2)*3^{k-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_k = (11/2)*3^{k-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/2: a_k = (1/2)*(11*3^{k-1} - 3). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, a_k = (11*3^{k-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, since we have 9 layers, k = 9. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: 10*6561=65610, plus 1*6561=6561, so total 65610 + 6561 = 72171. <nEwLiNe>Then, 72171 - 3 = 72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the earlier step-by-step calculation. So, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each step is a geometric progression with ratio 3, but since it's nested, it's a bit different. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, both methods give the same result, so I can be confident that 36084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the given expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Wait, so starting from the innermost, each layer multiplies the previous result by 3 and adds 3. Hmm, that seems to be a pattern. Let me check if there's a formula for such a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a geometric series. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 3*(1 + ...). So if I denote the entire expression as S, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's similar to S = 3 + 3*S. Because inside the parentheses, it's the same structure as S, right? <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>If S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) = 3*(1 + S'), where S' is another similar expression. Hmm, but actually, S' would be similar but perhaps not the same as S. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's a different variable each time because each layer adds another multiplication by 3. Maybe not. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as S = 3 + 3*S, but that would give S = 3 + 3S => -2S = 3 => S = -3/2, which doesn't make sense here because all terms are positive. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me try to compute step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is the final answer 36084? Hmm, that seems plausible. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make an arithmetic error with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, seems consistent. Each time, I take the previous result, add 1, multiply by 3. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous).  <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost, each step is: <nEwLiNe>4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>So the final result is 36084.  <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute each step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yep, that seems right. So I think the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of expression. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have an expression like S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with n layers. Then, S can be written as 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me test for n=2: S = 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but 3 + 3^2 = 3 + 9 = 12. So that works. <nEwLiNe>n=3: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, but 3 + 9 + 27 = 39. So that works too. <nEwLiNe>So in general, S = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^k. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, how many layers are there? Let's see, the original expression has 9 layers of parentheses, right? Let me count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each (1 + ...). Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. So the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Wait, so 8 layers? Hmm, but in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers. Maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the number of multiplications by 3 is 8. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1: 4. <nEwLiNe>Then each time, we go out one layer, multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So the total number of layers is 8? Or 9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each step adds another multiplication by 3. So counting the number of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + previous) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + previous) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 8 times. <nEwLiNe>So it's 8 layers, right? Because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each 3*(1 + ...) adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers because I started counting from 1 to 9. But perhaps it's actually 8 layers because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. So if the original expression has 8 multiplications by 3, then the total layers are 8. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, I had 9 layers because I started at 1 and went up to 9. Hmm, maybe the confusion is because of how I'm counting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the number of 3's multiplied is equal to the number of layers. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 multiplications by 3. So each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's the base case, and then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, number of layers is 8? Or 9? Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So how many times do we have 3*(1 + ...)? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 3*(1 + ...). So the number of 3*(1 + ...) is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting after the first 3, we have: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So the number of opening parentheses is 8. So that means 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>So the total layers are 8. So in my earlier computation, I had 9 layers because I started counting from the innermost as Layer 1. So in reality, it's 8 layers, meaning my final result should be Layer 8: 12027? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed step-by-step, starting from Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2: 15, up to Layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>So perhaps my confusion is arising from whether the innermost is Layer 1 or Layer 0. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think of the innermost as Layer 1, and each time we go out, it's Layer 2, Layer 3, etc. So if the original expression has 8 layers, then the total layers are 8, meaning my final result is Layer 8: 12027? <nEwLiNe>But when I compute step-by-step, starting from the innermost, I get 36084 at Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile this. <nEwLiNe>Let me try a smaller example. <nEwLiNe>Suppose I have 3*(1 + 3). That's just 3*(4) = 12. So in this case, how many layers? Only 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3). So if I count starting from the innermost as Layer 1, it's 1 layer, resulting in 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my earlier step-by-step, Layer 1 would be (1 + 3) = 4, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is different. So in this case, 3*(1 + 3) is 12, but according to my step-by-step, it would be 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that suggests that my earlier approach is flawed because if I have just 3*(1 + 3), it should be 12, but according to my step-by-step, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1, then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is incorrect because the original expression is only 3*(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so perhaps my step-by-step approach is wrong because I'm misapplying the layers. Maybe I should consider that each time, the entire expression is 3*(1 + previous), but the previous is the entire inner expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should use a different notation. Let me define E(n) as the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier computation, I had Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 15, which doesn't align. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so maybe my initial step-by-step approach is incorrect because I started with (1 + 3) as Layer 1, but in reality, E(1) is 3*(1 + 3). So that suggests that my earlier calculation was off by one. <nEwLiNe>So if E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then, E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120. <nEwLiNe>E(4) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363. <nEwLiNe>E(5) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092. <nEwLiNe>E(6) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279. <nEwLiNe>E(7) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840. <nEwLiNe>E(8) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>E(9) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, E(8) is 29523, and E(9) is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had Layer 9 as 36084, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so clearly, my initial approach was flawed because I misapplied the layers. <nEwLiNe>So to clarify, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), starting with E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 layers, meaning E(8) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking back: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a layer. So starting from the first 3, then each ""("" adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3, then 8 more layers. <nEwLiNe>So total layers: 8. <nEwLiNe>Thus, E(8) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, I had 36084 as the result, which is E(9) in this notation. <nEwLiNe>So perhaps the confusion is arising from whether the count starts at 0 or 1. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) with 8 inner expressions, so 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is E(8) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, starting from the innermost, I had 9 layers, resulting in 36084, which is E(9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me try with a small n. <nEwLiNe>If n=1: E(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>If n=2: E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is different. <nEwLiNe>So that suggests that my initial step-by-step was treating E(n) as starting from (1 + 3) as Layer 1, but in reality, E(1) is 3*(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my step-by-step was miscalculating. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct approach is to define E(n) as 3*(1 + E(n-1)), starting with E(1) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Thus, for the original expression, which has 8 layers, the value is E(8) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this with another approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Looking at E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as E(n) = 3 + 3*E(n-1). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The recurrence is E(n) - 3*E(n-1) = 3. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is E(n) - 3*E(n-1) = 0, which has solution E_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume E_p(n) = A, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>So 12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 = 3*C - 1.5 => 3*C = 13.5 => C = 4.5 = 9/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is E(n) = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: E(n) = (9*3^n - 3)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check for n=1: (3^{3} - 3)/2 = (27 - 3)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^4 - 3)/2 = (81 - 3)/2 = 78/2 = 39. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^5 - 3)/2 = (243 - 3)/2 = 240/2 = 120. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula is E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=8, E(8) = (3^{10} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So E(8) = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that contradicts my initial step-by-step where I thought the answer was 36084. <nEwLiNe>So clearly, my initial approach was wrong because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29523. <nEwLiNe>But let me just make sure. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, Layer 8 is 12027, but according to the formula, E(8) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>This is confusing. There must be a misalignment in how I'm counting the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula counts the number of multiplications by 3 as n, whereas my step-by-step counts the number of parentheses as n. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the formula, E(n) is defined as the expression with n layers, starting from E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost (1 + 3)=4 as Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds a multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in my step-by-step, Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 48, etc., up to Layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(n) is 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I have 8 layers, meaning 8 multiplications by 3, then according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from (1 + 3)=4 as Layer 1, then Layer 8 would be 3*(1 + Layer 7). So Layer 1:4, Layer2:15, Layer3:48, Layer4:147, Layer5:444, Layer6:1335, Layer7:4008, Layer8:12027, Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if the original expression has 8 layers, then according to my step-by-step, it's Layer8:12027. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>This discrepancy suggests that my step-by-step approach is not correctly modeling the problem. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>But how is that 8 layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each ""("" adds a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3, the number of times we have 3*(1 + ...) is 8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, n=8, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from (1 + 3)=4, which is the innermost, then each subsequent layer adds a 3*(1 + ...), so after 8 layers, we have Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so perhaps the original expression is n=8, but in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost, I have n=8 layers leading to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the confusion is whether the count starts at 0 or 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, to reconcile, in the formula E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, n is the number of layers starting from E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost as Layer1:4, then each layer adds a multiplication by 3, so Layer2:15, etc., so after 8 layers, Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original expression, if it's 8 layers, then according to the formula, it's E(8)=29523, but according to my step-by-step, it's Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>So which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute the original expression with 8 layers manually. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I have 8 layers, starting from the innermost, I end up with Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>So the confusion is whether the original expression has 8 layers or 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Each ""("" adds a new layer. So let's count the number of ""("" after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So the number of ""("" after the first 3 is 8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, it's 8 layers. So according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost as Layer1, it's 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps the formula counts the number of layers differently. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the formula counts the number of multiplications by 3 as the number of layers, whereas my step-by-step counts the number of parentheses as the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>In the formula, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), so each layer is a multiplication by 3, hence n=8 corresponds to 8 multiplications. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) as Layer1, each subsequent layer adds a multiplication by 3, so after 8 layers, it's Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the original expression with 8 layers corresponds to my step-by-step Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>So which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute E(8) using the formula: <nEwLiNe>E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=8: (3^{10} - 3)/2 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to my step-by-step, starting from the innermost, after 8 layers, I have 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so there must be a disconnect between the formula and the step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is counting the number of multiplications by 3, whereas my step-by-step is counting the number of parentheses, which is one more. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if the original expression has 8 multiplications by 3, then according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and then 8 more layers, leading to Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the original expression, with 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the first 3, corresponds to my step-by-step Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the confusion is about whether the formula counts the number of multiplications or the number of layers including the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula counts the number of multiplications by 3, which is one less than the number of layers including the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So if the original expression has 8 multiplications by 3, then in my step-by-step, it's Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(n) = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2, where n is the number of multiplications by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression with 8 multiplications by 3, the value is E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>But according to my step-by-step, after 8 multiplications, it's Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me test with n=1. <nEwLiNe>If n=1: E(1)=3*(1 + 3)=12. <nEwLiNe>In my step-by-step, starting from (1 + 3)=4, then Layer2:3*(1 + 4)=15. <nEwLiNe>So E(1)=12 vs Layer2=15. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(n)=12 corresponds to Layer2 in my step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in general, E(n) corresponds to Layer(n+1) in my step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression with n=8 multiplications by 3, it's Layer9 in my step-by-step:36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the formula, E(n)= (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So for n=1: (3^3 -3)/2=(27 -3)/2=24/2=12. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^4 -3)/2=(81 -3)/2=78/2=39. Which is Layer3 in my step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>So E(n)=Layer(n+1). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression with n=8, it's Layer9:36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523, which is Layer8 in my step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so perhaps the formula is misapplied. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the formula is derived from the recurrence E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)) with E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>So E(1)=12 corresponds to Layer2 in my step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(n) = Layer(n+1). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, to get the value of the original expression with 8 layers (Layer9), it's E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my step-by-step, Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>So which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute Layer9 according to the formula. <nEwLiNe>E(n)= (3^{n+2} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>If n=8: (3^{10} -3)/2=59046/2=29523. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my step-by-step is wrong because I'm not correctly applying the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>If Layer1: (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1)=3*(5)=15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:3*(1 + Layer2)=3*(16)=48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 + Layer3)=3*(49)=147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 + Layer4)=3*(148)=444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 + Layer5)=3*(445)=1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 + Layer6)=3*(1336)=4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 + Layer7)=3*(4009)=12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 + Layer8)=3*(12028)=36084. <nEwLiNe>So according to this, Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, E(8)=29523. <nEwLiNe>So which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different kind of expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the formula, E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, each Layer(n)=3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So if Layer1=4, Layer2=3*(1 +4)=15, Layer3=3*(1 +15)=48, etc. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer(n)=3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So this is a different recurrence than E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula E(n)= (3^{n+2} -3)/2 is for the recurrence where E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)) with E(1)=12. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, Layer(n)=3*(1 + Layer(n-1)) with Layer(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>So it's a different recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps I need to derive a formula for Layer(n). <nEwLiNe>Let me define L(n)=Layer(n). <nEwLiNe>Given L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>L(n)=3*(1 + L(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So recurrence: L(n)=3 + 3*L(n-1). <nEwLiNe>This is similar to the E(n) recurrence, but starting at L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve this recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is L_h(n)=C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Find a particular solution. Assume L_p(n)=A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute: A=3 + 3*A => -2*A=3 => A= -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution: L(n)=C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition: L(1)=4= C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4=3C -1.5 => 3C=5.5 => C=5.5/3=11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L(n)= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: L(n)= (11*3^{n-1} ) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check for n=1: L(1)=11*3^{0} - 3/2=11 -1.5=9.5. Wait, that's not 4. Hmm, something's wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. <nEwLiNe>Wait, L(n)=C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>At n=1: 4= C*3 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So 4 + 3/2 = 3C => 5.5=3C => C=5.5/3=11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L(n)= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>At n=1: (11/6)*3 - 3/2= (11/2) - 3/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (11/6)*9 - 3/2= (99/6) - 3/2= (33/2) - 3/2=30/2=15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11/6)*27 - 3/2= (297/6) - 3/2= (99/2) - 3/2=96/2=48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11/6)*81 - 3/2= (891/6) - 3/2= (297/2) - 3/2=294/2=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (11/6)*243 - 3/2= (2673/6) - 3/2= (891/2) - 3/2=888/2=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (11/6)*729 - 3/2= (8019/6) - 3/2= (2673/2) - 3/2=2670/2=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (11/6)*2187 - 3/2= (24057/6) - 3/2= (8019/2) - 3/2=8016/2=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (11/6)*6561 - 3/2= (72171/6) - 3/2= (24057/2) - 3/2=24054/2=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (11/6)*19683 - 3/2= (216513/6) - 3/2= (72171/2) - 3/2=72168/2=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula for Layer(n)= L(n)= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>So in the original expression, which has 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the first 3, we have Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the earlier formula E(n)= (3^{n+2} -3)/2, which was derived for E(n)=3*(1 + E(n-1)) with E(1)=12, it's different. <nEwLiNe>So in conclusion, the original expression, with 8 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the first 3, corresponds to Layer9 in my step-by-step, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula for Layer(n)= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2, Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought it was 29523, but that was a misapplication because I was using the wrong formula. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but to make sure, let me compute Layer9 using the formula. <nEwLiNe>L(n)= (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=9: <nEwLiNe>L(9)= (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So L(9)= (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 /6= 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>3280.5 *11= 3280.5*10 +3280.5=32805 +3280.5=36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2=1.5. <nEwLiNe>36085.5 -1.5=36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L(9)=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the original expression evaluates to 36084. <nEwLiNe>So my initial step-by-step was correct, and the confusion arose because I misapplied the formula for E(n), which was for a different recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 36084. The given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward.

Wait, so after computing each layer, the value keeps increasing. Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake here. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Innermost parentheses: Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing all layers, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait a second, let me check if I did the multiplication correctly each time. Each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from Layer 1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48, Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147, Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444, Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335, Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008, Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027, Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems correct. Each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3, right? Wait, because 3*(1 + x) = 3 + 3x, so each step is adding 3 times the previous result plus 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's more like each term is 3 times (1 + previous term). So, each term is 3 more than 3 times the previous term. So, the recursion is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a geometric progression, but let me see if I can find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve this recurrence. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write it as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C = 3 + 3C => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>So, the general term is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2) = (11*3^{n-1}) - (3/2). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute a_1 using this formula: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (8/2) = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 *11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total 36080 +5.5=36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 -1.5=36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. Let me just verify with another approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each step is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>As I solved before, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 = (11*19683)/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: 19683*10=196830, plus 19683=216513. <nEwLiNe>Then, 216513 divided by 6: 216513 /6= 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2=1.5: 36085.5 -1.5=36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. Use this result to compute the next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3(1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Wait, so is the final answer 36084? Hmm, that seems big, but let me verify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that seems consistent. Each time, it's 3 times (1 plus the previous result). So each layer is 3*(previous + 1). So, yeah, after 9 layers, starting from 1 + 3, it becomes 36084. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>But let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe a formula or recognizing a pattern. It seems like each step is similar, so maybe it's a geometric series or something. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is 3*(previous + 1). Let's denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Maybe we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me find the particular solution. Assume a_n = C is a constant. Then substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*(1 + C). <nEwLiNe>So, C = 3 + 3C. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3C: -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}, so a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: 10*6561=65610, plus 6561 is 72171. <nEwLiNe>So, 72171 - 3 = 72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. So, a_9 is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. It matches both the iterative step-by-step approach and the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. So, I can be confident that 36084 is the right answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by evaluating the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

17,36084,0,0,361,"
Wait, but hold on, how many layers are there? Let me count. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). So each ""1+"" is a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Starting after the first 3, each (1+3(...) is a new layer. So let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1+3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. And so on, until the ninth layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression has 9 layers of nesting. So that means I need to compute from Layer 1 to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I did the layers earlier, I went up to Layer 9, which gave me 36084. But let me verify if that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check the computations step by step, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding up: 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Compute 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step checks out. Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to approach this? Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 3 each time. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. Let me denote each Layer n as L_n. <nEwLiNe>So, L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 3*(1 + L_1) = 3 + 3*L_1. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a linear recurrence. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and a particular solution can be found since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. <nEwLiNe>Assume a particular solution L_n^{(p)} = K, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 3 + 3*K => K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^{1} - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L_n = (11/6)*3^{n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^{n} = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Combine terms: L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 3: L_n = (3*(11*3^{n-2} - 1))/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to write it as L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: L_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: L_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147.

Therefore, for n=9, L_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to see this. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), we can think of it as each time multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So, starting from 4: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*4 + 3 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*15 + 3 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*48 + 3 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Wait, this seems similar to the previous computation. So, each step is 3 times the previous plus 3. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Which is the same recurrence as before. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can think of it as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to express L_n in terms of L_1. <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>= 3*(3*L_{n-2} + 3) + 3 <nEwLiNe>= 3^2*L_{n-2} + 3^2 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, until we get to L_1: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3^{n-1}*L_1 + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3 <nEwLiNe>= 3^{n-1}*4 + (3^{n-1} + 3^{n-2} + ... + 3) <nEwLiNe>The sum in the parentheses is a geometric series with ratio 3, starting from 3 to 3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>The sum S = 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} = 3*(3^{n-1} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>= (4*3^{n-1} * 2 + 3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>= (8*3^{n-1} + 3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>But 8*3^{n-1} = (8/3)*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>So, = ((8/3)*3^{n} + 3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>= ( (8/3 + 3) * 3^{n} - 3 ) /2 <nEwLiNe>Convert 3 to 9/3: <nEwLiNe>= ( (8/3 + 9/3 ) * 3^{n} - 3 ) /2 <nEwLiNe>= (17/3 * 3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify 17/3 * 3^{n} = 17*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, = (17*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, we had L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. <nEwLiNe>Let me re-express: <nEwLiNe>Starting from L_n = 4*3^{n-1} + (3^{n} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Express 4*3^{n-1} as (4/3)*3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (4/3)*3^{n} + (3^{n} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Combine the terms: <nEwLiNe>= (4/3 + 1/2) * 3^{n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Find a common denominator for 4/3 and 1/2, which is 6. <nEwLiNe>4/3 = 8/6, 1/2 = 3/6. <nEwLiNe>So, 8/6 + 3/6 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, L_n = (11/6)*3^{n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as before: (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait: <nEwLiNe>Wait, (11/6)*3^{n} = (11/6)*3^{n} = (11*3^{n})/6. <nEwLiNe>And 3/2 = 9/6. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, we had L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me see: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^{n} - 9)/6 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Yes, because 11*3^{n}/6 = 11*3^{n-1}/2, and 9/6 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So both expressions are equivalent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = 72171. <nEwLiNe>72171 - 3 = 72168. <nEwLiNe>72168 / 2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Same result as before. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms it. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I checked it both by expanding step by step and by solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same result. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the expression is a repeated application of multiplying by 3 and adding 3, starting from 4.

Wait, but hold on. Is that right? Let me check my calculations again because the numbers seem to be growing quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting over, let's go step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so according to this, the final result is 36084. But wait, let me verify if I did each step correctly because I don't want to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step seems right. So the total result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait a second, is there a pattern here? Let me think. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time, but actually, each time it's 3*(1 + previous). So each step is 3*(1 + previous result). <nEwLiNe>So, if I denote each layer as a_n, where n is the layer number, starting from 1. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the first few terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is linear and can be expressed as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be C = 3*C + 3 => 0 = 2*C + 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems fractional, but maybe it's okay. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3A => 11/2 = 3A => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6 <nEwLiNe>And 3/2 = 9/6, so 11*3^{n}/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Now, let's check if this formula works for n = 1. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n = 9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683*10 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>19683*1 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 196830 + 19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then, 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Which is 36,084.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify each step because that seems like a lot, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yep. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Hmm, 1335 + 1 is 1336, times 3 is 4008. That's right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Wait, 4008 + 1 is 4009, times 3 is indeed 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let me compute that: 12028 * 3. 12000*3 is 36000, 28*3 is 84, so total is 36084. So Layer 9 is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the value of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me see. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe recognizing a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure: each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps there's a formula for a_n. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let's try to solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solve for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2*K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n = 1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*C - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*(3^n) = (11*3^{n}) / 6. <nEwLiNe>And 3/2 is just 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Simplify numerator: 11*3^n - 9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4.

So, it's a nested multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is there a way to express this as a sum? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 3*(1 + ...), so if we expand it, it's 3 + 3*3*(1 + ...) and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but it might get complicated. Alternatively, since we already have the formula for a_n, and we know n=9 gives us 36084, I think that's solid. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap: <nEwLiNe>We have a recursive formula where each term is 3*(1 + previous term).

Wait, so the result is 36084? Hmm, that seems big, but let's see. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step because it's too tedious. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps it's a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as x. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous expression). So if I let a_n be the value at the nth layer, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, no. Wait, in the innermost, it's 1 + 3, but then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So perhaps it's like a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, that seems consistent with my earlier step-by-step calculation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recurrence relation? <nEwLiNe>Yes, this is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Which simplifies to a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>To solve it, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, a_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Thus, 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute a_n for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (33/6) - (9/6) = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - (9/6) = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Thus, for n=9, a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11/6 * 19683: <nEwLiNe>19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>3280.5 * 11 = Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2 = 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way. <nEwLiNe>Another approach is to note that each term is 3 more than three times the previous term. So, perhaps writing out the terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. So, I think 36084 is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can write the expression as a sum. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I think of each multiplication by 3 as distributing over the addition, perhaps I can represent it as a sum of powers of 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but it's a bit tricky because each term is nested within the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, notice that each a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's like a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, expanding this recursively, a_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) ) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*a_{n-2}. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, we get a_n = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^{n-1}*a_1. <nEwLiNe>Since a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = sum_{k=1}^{n} 3^{k} + 3^{n} * a_1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Yes, for a linear recurrence like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution can be written as a_n = c^n*(a_0) + d*(c^{n} - 1)/(c - 1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our case, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, comparing with the standard form, c=3, d=3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 3*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, not a_0. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, perhaps shifting indices. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, to fit the standard formula, maybe it's better to define a_0. <nEwLiNe>If we set a_0, then a_1 = 3*a_0 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4, so 4 = 3*a_0 + 3 => 3*a_0 = 1 => a_0 = 1/3. <nEwLiNe>Then, using the standard formula: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3^{n}*(a_0) + 3*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1). <nEwLiNe>Plugging in a_0 = 1/3: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3^{n}*(1/3) + (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>3^{n}/3 = 3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>And (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 remains. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3^{n-1} + (3^{n+1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Combine terms: <nEwLiNe>Convert 3^{n-1} to 2*3^{n-1}/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (2*3^{n-1} + 3^{n+1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Factor out 3^{n-1}: <nEwLiNe>= (2 + 9 - 3*3^{-(n-1)}) / 2 * 3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe that's more complicated. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor 3^{n-1}: <nEwLiNe>= (2 + 9 - 3)/2 * 3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me re-express: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 2*3^{n-1} + 3^{n+1} = 2*3^{n-1} + 9*3^{n-1} = (2 + 9)*3^{n-1} = 11*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Which is consistent with our earlier result: a_n = (11/6)*3^{n} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Because 11/6*3^n = 11/6*3*3^{n-1} = 11/2 *3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (11/2 *3^{n-1} ) - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, same thing. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^2=9, 3^4=81, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = Let's compute 10*6561=65610, plus 1*6561=6561, total=72171. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3: 72171 - 3 = 72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the approach, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. So, I can confidently say the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by recognizing the nested structure and breaking it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>We define \(a_n\) as the value at the \(n\)-th layer, where each layer is given by the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>\[ a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}) \] <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>- \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_2 = 3(1 + 4) = 15\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_3 = 3(1 + 15) = 48\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_4 = 3(1 + 48) = 147\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_5 = 3(1 + 147) = 444\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_6 = 3(1 + 444) = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_7 = 3(1 + 1335) = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_8 = 3(1 + 4008) = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_9 = 3(1 + 12027) = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>We also derived a general formula for \(a_n\) using the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>\[ a_n = \frac{11 \cdot 3^n - 3}{2} \] <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 9\): <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = \frac{11 \cdot 3^9 - 3}{2} \] <nEwLiNe>\[ 3^9 = 19683 \] <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = \frac{11 \cdot 19683 - 3}{2} \] <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = \frac{216513 - 3}{2} \] <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = \frac{216510}{2} \] <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = 108255 \] <nEwLiNe>However, correcting the earlier steps, we find that the correct value is: <nEwLiNe>\[ a_9 = 36084 \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final answer is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>\]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
