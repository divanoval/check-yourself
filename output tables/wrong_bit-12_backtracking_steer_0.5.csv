Intended answer: 88572

 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something).

Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). <nEwLiNe>Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. 1 plus 3 is 4. So, replacing that part, the next layer is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Got that. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)). Wait, but I just computed the innermost part as 12. So, substituting that in, the next layer becomes 1 + 12. Hmm, 1 + 12 is 13. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 3 * 13, which is 39. Okay, so that layer is 39. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step to keep track: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Then: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Then: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Then: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Then: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next: 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Then: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next: 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Then: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Next: 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check if I did that right. Each time, it's 1 plus the previous result, then multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so after each step, it's 1 + (previous result), then multiplied by 3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). Let me see if there's a pattern here. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the numbers I got: 4, 12, 13, 39, 40, 120, 121, 363, 364, 1092, 1093, 3279, 3280, 9840, 9841, 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, the numbers after each multiplication by 3 seem to be one less than a multiple of 4 or something? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the results: 4, 12, 39, 120, 363, 1092, 3279, 9840, 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4 is 3*1 + 1? Hmm, not sure. 12 is 3*4, which is 12. Then 39 is 3*13, 120 is 3*40, 363 is 3*121, 1092 is 3*364, 3279 is 3*1093, 9840 is 3*3280, and 29523 is 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>So each time, it's 3 times a number that's just 1 more than the previous multiple of 3. Like, 4 is 3 +1, 13 is 12 +1, 40 is 39 +1, 121 is 120 +1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, each step is multiplying 3 by (previous result +1). So, in mathematical terms, each term is 3*(previous term +1). So, if I denote the terms as a sequence, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_{n+1} = 3*(a_n +1). Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is this a geometric sequence or something? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(4 +1) = 15? Wait, no, wait, earlier I had a_2 as 12. Wait, no, in my previous step-by-step, starting from innermost, the first result was 4, then 12, then 13, then 39, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I messed up the indexing. Let me re-examine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 12 = 13. Then, moving out, 3*(1 + 12) = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. So, each time, it alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>12. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>14. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>16. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 29523. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake in such a long chain. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, starting from the innermost 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to model this. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each term is a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n). <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15? Wait, no, in my previous calculation, a_2 was 12. Hmm, confusion here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the initial step-by-step, a_2 was 12, which is 3*(1 + 3). But according to the sequence, a_1 is 4, then a_2 is 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15. But that contradicts my earlier calculation. So, perhaps my indexing is off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I thought it was 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Hmm, confusion arises because maybe I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the next layer is 3*(1 + (previous)). So, the first innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought it was 3*(1 + 3) = 12. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the parentheses. Let me write the entire expression with all the parentheses: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 15 = 16 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 16) = 51 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 51 = 52 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 52) = 159 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 159 = 160 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 160) = 483 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 483 = 484 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 484) = 1455 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1455 = 1456 <nEwLiNe>12. 3*(1 + 1456) = 4369 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 4369 = 4370 <nEwLiNe>14. 3*(1 + 4370) = 13113 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 13113 = 13114 <nEwLiNe>16. 3*(1 + 13114) = 39345 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, this is a different result than before. So, now I'm confused. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of 1 + 3 expressions. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and the number of such layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(...), and the outermost is 3*(...). So, total layers: innermost is 1 + 3, then 3*(1 + ...), so each pair is a layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of 1 + 3(...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then: <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until we have 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm really confused. Maybe I should write the expression with indices. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say we have n layers. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer alternates between multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then multiplied by 3, then 1 + (result), then multiplied by 3, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, it's like a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(16) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(49) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(148) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(445) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1336) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(4009) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(12028) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(36085) = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has only 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), right? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many 1 + 3(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 1 + 3 is a new layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many times does ""1 + 3("" appear? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, after the first 3, there are 9 instances of 1 + 3(...). So, total layers are 9. So, n = 9. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4, each a_{k+1} = 3*(1 + a_k). So, with n=9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had 16 steps, but perhaps that's because I was counting both the innermost and outermost operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and each layer alternates between 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*(1 + 16) = 51, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is either adding 1 or multiplying by 3. So, for each pair, it's two operations: 1 + (something), then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1 to the previous result. <nEwLiNe>So, in terms of the recurrence, it's a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with n layers, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>n=2, a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>n=3, a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>n=4, a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>n=5, a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>n=6, a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>n=7, a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>n=8, a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>n=9, a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, with 9 layers, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I got 29523. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" after the first 3 is a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, the first layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent layer adds another 3(1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until Layer 9: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers. Therefore, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 16 operations, leading to 29523. That must be incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I was counting each addition and multiplication as a separate step, leading to confusion. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let me try to compute it correctly with the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(16) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(49) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(148) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(445) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1336) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(4009) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(12028) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had a different result. So, perhaps I made a mistake there. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try computing it again, carefully, step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the recurrence, it should be 3*(1 + 4) = 15. So, discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which is correct? Is the second layer 3*(1 + 3) or 3*(1 + 4)? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*(1 + 16) = 51, and so on. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial calculation, I thought the second layer was 3*(1 + 3) = 12, but that seems incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in the order of operations. Let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 1 + 15 = 16. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after the innermost, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 1 + 15 = 16. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, is it 3*(1 + 3*(...)) or 3*(1 + 3*(...))? So, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 51. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous layer), not alternating between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, in that case, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with n=9, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I was doing: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, it should be: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm getting a different result. So, confusion arises because of the way the layers are structured. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to model it as a recurrence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>So, with 9 layers, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 16 steps, getting 29523, but that seems to be incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, with 9 layers, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 16 operations, but perhaps that was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression has 9 layers, each of the form 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, each preceded by an addition of 1. <nEwLiNe>So, the expression can be written as: <nEwLiNe>a = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>With 9 threes. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with n=9, a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) <nEwLiNe>Let me compute this step by step: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial calculation, I had a different result. So, where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I was doing: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, this is incorrect because each layer should be 3*(1 + previous layer), not alternating between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in the structure of the expression. Let me parse it correctly. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 51. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), not 3*(1 + 3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so the previous layer is 3*(...), not just the number. <nEwLiNe>So, in that case, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 51. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 51) = 156. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial calculation, I thought it was 29523. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 51. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 51) = 156. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 156) = 471. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 471) = 1416. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271. <nEwLiNe>So, with 9 layers, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had a different approach, leading to 29523, which must be incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is parsed differently. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the ... is 8 layers deep. <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this with a smaller case. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have only 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the recurrence, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15. So, discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so perhaps the initial term is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if we have only 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 15. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the indexing is off. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence should start from a_0 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me redefine. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_0 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_1 = 1 + a_0 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 51 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 156 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 471 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>So, with a_0 = 3, a_1 = 4, up to a_9 = 38271. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the original expression, which has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), starting from the innermost 1 + 3, results in a_9 = 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in the smaller case of 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12, which corresponds to a_2 = 15? No, 12 ≠ 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, confusion again. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the number of layers is one less. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I have 1 layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then, 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>3 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, the number of layers is equal to the number of 3's in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression has 9 3's after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let's count: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3's is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, starting from 3*(1 + 3), which is 12, then 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 39, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, for 1 three: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>For 2 threes: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 39 <nEwLiNe>For 3 threes: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 120 <nEwLiNe>So, each additional three adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with 9 threes, the result is the 9th term in this sequence. <nEwLiNe>So, let's define b_n as the result with n threes. <nEwLiNe>Then: <nEwLiNe>b_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>b_2 = 3*(1 + b_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>b_3 = 3*(1 + b_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>b_4 = 3*(1 + b_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>b_5 = 3*(1 + b_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>b_6 = 3*(1 + b_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>b_7 = 3*(1 + b_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>b_8 = 3*(1 + b_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>b_9 = 3*(1 + b_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so with 9 threes, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my previous calculation, starting from a_0 = 3, a_9 = 38271. <nEwLiNe>This is conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and the number of such layers is 9, starting from 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in the other approach, where b_9 = 88572, that seems different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the difference arises because in one approach, we start counting layers from the innermost 1 + 3, while in the other, we count the number of threes. <nEwLiNe>So, in the original expression, the number of threes is 9, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 threes. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in the other approach, where b_1 = 12, b_2 = 39, etc., that seems to be a different starting point. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is that in one case, we start with 1 + 3 as the innermost, and in the other, we start with 3*(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had a different result because I was alternating between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which seems to be incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But to confirm, let me compute it step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the initial step-by-step, I had: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>But according to the correct parsing, this approach is wrong because it alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, which doesn't match the structure of the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 38271. <nEwLiNe>But let me check this with another method. <nEwLiNe>Notice that each term is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>Let me find A and B. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Assume solution a_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3*(1 + A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + A*3^{n-1} + B) = 3 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Therefore, equation: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 3 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 3 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, B = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>So, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But let's compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5 *11=5.5, so total 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the recurrence, a_9 should be 38271. <nEwLiNe>Wait, discrepancy here. So, where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the general solution was a_n = A*3^n + B, which led to a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>But when n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1: (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = 11/2 - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4.

But according to the general solution, it's 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute a_9 using the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>But according to the general solution, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>This discrepancy suggests that there is a mistake in either the recurrence or the general solution. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check a_4. <nEwLiNe>Using recurrence: a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>Using general solution: a_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 147 ≠ 156. So, the general solution is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so where did I go wrong in solving the recurrence? <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite it: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the solution to the homogeneous equation plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^h = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Particular solution: Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solve for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution: a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But when n=4, a_4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147 <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_4 = 156. <nEwLiNe>So, inconsistency. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but I thought the recurrence was a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Yes, so a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the recurrence is correct. <nEwLiNe>But the general solution suggests a different value. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Given a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>But according to the general solution: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = 11/2 - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Correct. <nEwLiNe>But a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>According to general solution: a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = 99/6 - 3/2 = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.

Incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the general solution gives a_3 = 48, but according to recurrence, a_3 = 51. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so what is the issue? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the recurrence is not a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, but something else. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me re-express the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is correct, but perhaps the particular solution is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try again. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3 <nEwLiNe>We assume a particular solution of the form a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But when n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3 - 3/2 => C = (4 + 3/2)/3 = (11/2)/3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But when n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48 <nEwLiNe>But according to recurrence, a_3 = 51 <nEwLiNe>So, discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this suggests that the general solution is not matching the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>But why? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial condition is not correctly applied. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute a_0. <nEwLiNe>If n=0, a_0 would be? <nEwLiNe>From the general solution: a_0 = (11/6)*1 - 3/2 = 11/6 - 9/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 <nEwLiNe>But in our problem, a_1 = 4, which corresponds to the innermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the indexing is shifted. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence starts at n=0. <nEwLiNe>Let me redefine: <nEwLiNe>Let a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_1 = 3*(1 + a_0) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 51 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_0 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution would be a_n = C*3^n + D <nEwLiNe>But the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^h = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Particular solution: assume a_n^p = K <nEwLiNe>Substitute: K = 3*K + 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution: a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_0 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*1 - 3/2 => C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, compute a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/2)*3^9 - 3/2 = (11/2)*19683 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 19683 / 2 = 9841.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 11 * 9841.5 = let's compute 10*9841.5 = 98415, plus 9841.5 = 108256.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 108256.5 - 1.5 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_9 should be 38271. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now it's even more conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the confusion arises because the initial term is a_0 = 4, but the number of layers is 9, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>But according to the general solution, a_9 = 108255, which is way larger than the step-by-step recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, something is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the general solution is not applicable here because the recurrence is not correctly set up. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try a different approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute the expression directly, step by step, carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 51 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 51) = 156 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 156) = 471 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 471) = 1416 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1416) = 4251 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4251) = 12756 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12756) = 38271 <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step, it's 38271. <nEwLiNe>But according to the general solution, with a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2, starting from n=0: <nEwLiNe>a_0 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 51 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 156 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 471 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1416 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 4251 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 12756 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 38271 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 114813 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so a_8 = 38271, which matches our step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But when n=8, a_8 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/2) - 3/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the step-by-step, a_8 = 38271 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 36084 ≠ 38271 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is not matching. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the mistake is that the general solution was derived for a different indexing. <nEwLiNe>If a_0 = 4, then a_8 = 38271 <nEwLiNe>But according to the general solution, a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_8 = (11/2)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/2) - 3/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>But according to the step-by-step, a_8 = 38271 <nEwLiNe>So, discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence is not linear as I thought. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the recurrence again. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Particular solution: assume a_n^p = K <nEwLiNe>Substitute: K = 3 + 3*K => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution: a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_0 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*1 - 3/2 => C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (11/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But when n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/2)*3 - 3/2 = 33/2 - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). That's simple: 1 + 3 is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, let me look again. The structure is 3(1 + 3(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer). Hmm, maybe I should write this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So layer 1 is the innermost (1 + 3). Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer1), layer3 is 3*(1 + layer2), and so on until layer9, which is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Hmm, 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; adding up 300+120=420+24=444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15; so 1200+120=1320+15=1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18; so 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27; so 12000+27=12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 12028*3: Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>12000*3=36000 <nEwLiNe>28*3=84 <nEwLiNe>So, 36000 + 84 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each layer seems to check out. So the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can see a pattern here. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + term before). Maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n + c = 3*(1 + a_{n-1} + c). Wait, maybe not. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can write it as a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 3*A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: a_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3) <nEwLiNe>But let me check if this formula works for n=1. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (1/2)*(11*3^{0} - 3) = (1/2)*(11 - 3) = (1/2)*8 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: (1/2)*(11*3^{1} - 3) = (1/2)*(33 - 3) = (1/2)*30 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: (1/2)*(11*9 - 3) = (1/2)*(99 - 3) = (1/2)*96 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, which is our case, the value should be: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (1/2)*(11*3^{8} - 3) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = Let's compute 10*6561 = 65610, plus 1*6561 = 6561, so total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171 <nEwLiNe>Then, 72171 - 3 = 72168 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1/2)*72168 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's the same result as before. Therefore, the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), which is a geometric progression but with an added constant. But since I already solved the recurrence relation, and confirmed the result, I think 36084 is correct. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the expression is built with 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with (1 + the previous layer's result). After computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution, I'm confident that the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: \(3 \times (1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: \(3 \times (1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: \(3 \times (1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\) <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: \(3 \times (1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\) <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: \(3 \times (1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: \(3 \times (1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: \(3 \times (1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: \(3 \times (1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me see if I can break this down step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>The next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3). Since I just found that 1 + 3 is 4, this becomes 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the next layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So now, that layer is 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*40. Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 121. That seems familiar. It's a perfect square, 11 squared. Interesting, but maybe not relevant here. Let me keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*121. Calculating 3*121: 121*3 is 363, then 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 364. Moving out, next expression: 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*364: 364*3. Let me do that step by step: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer simplifies to 1093. Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. Adding those: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Alright, that's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. Adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Whoa, 9841. That's also a perfect square, 99 squared. Nice, but again, maybe not directly relevant. Let's keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 29524. Moving out to the next layer: 1 + 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*29524: Let's break it down. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot. Let me verify that calculation because 3*29524 should be 88572, and adding 1 gives 88573. Hmm, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, the next expression is 1 + 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*88573: Let's compute 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 265720. Now, moving out to the very outer layer, the entire original expression is 3 times that result. So, 3*265720. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding those together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that can't be right because 265720*3 is 797160? Let me check that again. 265720 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 265720 * 3: <nEwLiNe>200000*3=600000 <nEwLiNe>60000*3=180000 <nEwLiNe>5000*3=15000 <nEwLiNe>700*3=2100 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>So, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>600000 + 180000 = 780000 <nEwLiNe>780000 + 15000 = 795000 <nEwLiNe>795000 + 2100 = 797100 <nEwLiNe>797100 + 60 = 797160 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, 3*265720 is indeed 797160. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797,160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me double-check each step because that seems like a huge number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720 <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*265720 = 797160 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent each step. So, unless I made an arithmetic mistake somewhere, the final result should be 797,160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify the multiplication steps again because it's easy to make a mistake with large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from 265720 * 3: <nEwLiNe>265,720 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>200,000 * 3 = 600,000 <nEwLiNe>60,000 * 3 = 180,000 <nEwLiNe>5,000 * 3 = 15,000 <nEwLiNe>700 * 3 = 2,100 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them: <nEwLiNe>600,000 + 180,000 = 780,000 <nEwLiNe>780,000 + 15,000 = 795,000 <nEwLiNe>795,000 + 2,100 = 797,100 <nEwLiNe>797,100 + 60 = 797,160 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Another way to verify: 265,720 * 3.

Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, all the steps check out, and the final result is 797,160. <nEwLiNe>I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{797160}.

Then, 2,391,480 + 3 = 2,391,483. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 797,161 = 2,391,483. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 2,391,483. <nEwLiNe>1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3 times that. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 2,391,484. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000 <nEwLiNe>391,484 * 3: Let me break it down. <nEwLiNe>300,000 * 3 = 900,000 <nEwLiNe>90,000 * 3 = 270,000 <nEwLiNe>1,000 * 3 = 3,000 <nEwLiNe>400 * 3 = 1,200 <nEwLiNe>80 * 3 = 240 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: 900,000 + 270,000 = 1,170,000. Then, 1,170,000 + 3,000 = 1,173,000. Then, 1,173,000 + 1,200 = 1,174,200. Then, 1,174,200 + 240 = 1,174,440. Then, 1,174,440 + 12 = 1,174,452. <nEwLiNe>Now, adding that to the 6,000,000: <nEwLiNe>6,000,000 + 1,174,452 = 7,174,452. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>2,391,484 * 3. <nEwLiNe>2,000,000 * 3 = 6,000,000 <nEwLiNe>391,484 * 3: <nEwLiNe>300,000 * 3 = 900,000 <nEwLiNe>90,000 * 3 = 270,000 <nEwLiNe>1,000 * 3 = 3,000 <nEwLiNe>400 * 3 = 1,200 <nEwLiNe>80 * 3 = 240 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, 900,000 + 270,000 = 1,170,000 <nEwLiNe>1,170,000 + 3,000 = 1,173,000 <nEwLiNe>1,173,000 + 1,200 = 1,174,200 <nEwLiNe>1,174,200 + 240 = 1,174,440 <nEwLiNe>1,174,440 + 12 = 1,174,452 <nEwLiNe>Then, 6,000,000 + 1,174,452 = 7,174,452. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 7,174,452. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on a second. Let me recount how many layers I have. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with nine sets of parentheses. Let me check how many times I computed each step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3 * 9841 = 29,523 <nEwLiNe>17. 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>18. 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>19. 1 + 88,572 = 88,573 <nEwLiNe>20. 3 * 88,573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>21. 1 + 265,719 = 265,720 <nEwLiNe>22. 3 * 265,720 = 797,160 <nEwLiNe>23. 1 + 797,160 = 797,161 <nEwLiNe>24. 3 * 797,161 = 2,391,483 <nEwLiNe>25. 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484 <nEwLiNe>26. 3 * 2,391,484 = 7,174,452 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 26 steps. But the original expression has nine layers. So, each layer adds two steps: one addition and one multiplication. So, for nine layers, that should be 18 steps? But I have 26 steps. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Each layer is a pair of parentheses, which requires one addition and one multiplication. So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds two operations. So, with nine layers, the total number of operations would be 2*9=18, but since we start with 1+3, which is the first layer, maybe it's 9 layers, each with a multiplication and addition. So, maybe it's 9 additions and 9 multiplications. Let's recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, each ""1 +"" is followed by a 3(...). So, the number of 1 + 3(...) is nine. So, each of those requires an addition and a multiplication. So, for each of the nine layers, we have an addition and a multiplication. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each step is: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (addition) <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 (addition) <nEwLiNe>4. Then, 3 * 13 = 39 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 (addition) <nEwLiNe>6. Then, 3 * 40 = 120 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 (addition) <nEwLiNe>8. Then, 3 * 121 = 363 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 (addition) <nEwLiNe>10. Then, 3 * 364 = 1092 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 (addition) <nEwLiNe>12. Then, 3 * 1093 = 3279 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 (addition) <nEwLiNe>14. Then, 3 * 3280 = 9840 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 (addition) <nEwLiNe>16. Then, 3 * 9841 = 29,523 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 (addition) <nEwLiNe>18. Then, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88,572 = 88,573 (addition) <nEwLiNe>20. Then, 3 * 88,573 = 265,719 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>21. Next layer: 1 + 265,719 = 265,720 (addition) <nEwLiNe>22. Then, 3 * 265,720 = 797,160 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>23. Next layer: 1 + 797,160 = 797,161 (addition) <nEwLiNe>24. Then, 3 * 797,161 = 2,391,483 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>25. Next layer: 1 + 2,391,483 = 2,391,484 (addition) <nEwLiNe>26. Then, 3 * 2,391,484 = 7,174,452 (multiplication) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 26 steps, but I think I'm miscounting the layers. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and each layer requires an addition and a multiplication. So, 9 layers would require 9 additions and 9 multiplications, totaling 18 operations. But here, I have 13 additions and 13 multiplications. That suggests I might have miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think differently. Maybe each ""1 +"" is a layer, so starting from the innermost, each layer is a step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should think of it as a geometric series or something similar. Because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe it's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but wait, that's not matching my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in my initial computation, the innermost was 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4=12, then 1 + 12=13, then 3*13=39, etc. So, each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps it's better to model it as starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, it's like a recurrence relation where each term is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>a_{10} = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>a_{11} = 1 + 3*a_{10} = 1 + 3*88573 = 265720. <nEwLiNe>a_{12} = 1 + 3*a_{11} = 1 + 3*265720 = 797161. <nEwLiNe>a_{13} = 1 + 3*a_{12} = 1 + 3*797161 = 2391484. <nEwLiNe>a_{14} = 1 + 3*a_{13} = 1 + 3*2391484 = 7174453. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, the final result was 7,174,452, but here, with this recurrence, it's 7,174,453. Hmm, there's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check where the error might be. In the step-by-step, after 2,391,483, I added 1 to get 2,391,484, then multiplied by 3 to get 7,174,452. But in the recurrence, a_{13} is 2,391,484, then a_{14} is 1 + 3*2,391,484 = 1 + 7,174,452 = 7,174,453. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the original expression, how many layers are there? The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, let's count the number of 1 + 3(...). Each ""1 +"" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3( Layer 1 ) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3( Layer 2 ) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3( Layer 8 ) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, in total, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, according to that, the total number of layers is 9, so a_1 to a_9, and then the final result is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, let's recast the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that's conflicting with my earlier step-by-step where I had 26 steps leading to 7,174,452. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think I see the confusion. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, that is, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after nine layers, we have a_9, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I continued beyond a_9, which was incorrect because the expression only has nine layers, so after a_9, we just multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does ""1 + 3("" appear? <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer wraps another 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers? Let's count the number of ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>From the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""("" after the first one corresponds to a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3( Layer 1 ) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3( Layer 2 ) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3( Layer 8 ) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*( Layer 9 ) <nEwLiNe>So, the total layers are 9, each being 1 + 3*(previous). Therefore, we have a_1 to a_9, with a_1 = 4, and a_9 = 29,524 as computed earlier. Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's conflicting with my initial step-by-step. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial computation, I went beyond a_9, but according to the structure of the expression, there are only nine layers, so after a_9, we just multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me re-examine the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of ""1 + 3("" is nine. Therefore, Layer 9 is the outermost 1 + 3(...), and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went all the way up to 7,174,452, which would be if the expression had 13 layers instead of 9. So, I must have miscounted the layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>So, to resolve this confusion, perhaps I should write out the layers explicitly. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression with each layer labeled: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial step-by-step, I went beyond Layer 9, which was incorrect. The expression only has nine layers, so after Layer 9, we just multiply by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial computation was wrong because I continued beyond the ninth layer, which wasn't part of the original expression. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me confirm this by another method. Maybe using the formula for such a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Given that each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Solve for B: B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers, leading me to compute beyond the ninth layer. The correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize, the expression is a recurrence relation with nine layers, leading to a_9 = 29,524, and the final result is 3 times that, which is 88,572. The given expression is a nested recurrence relation with nine layers. By solving the recurrence, we find the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, the innermost part is just 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, hold on, let me check the structure again. Each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that: 1 + 4 is 5, then 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 3*(1 + 15). Hmm, 1 + 15 is 16, so 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 3*(1 + 48). 1 + 48 is 49, so 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 3*(1 + 147). 1 + 147 is 148, so 3*148. Let me compute that: 140*3 is 420, and 8*3 is 24, so 420 + 24 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 3*(1 + 444). 1 + 444 is 445, so 3*445. Hmm, 400*3 is 1200, 40*3 is 120, and 5*3 is 15. So adding those together: 1200 + 120 is 1320, plus 15 is 1335. <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 3*(1 + 1335). 1 + 1335 is 1336, so 3*1336. Let me compute that: 1000*3 is 3000, 300*3 is 900, 30*3 is 90, and 6*3 is 18. So adding those: 3000 + 900 is 3900, plus 90 is 3990, plus 18 is 4008. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 3*(1 + 4008). 1 + 4008 is 4009, so 3*4009. Calculating that: 4000*3 is 12000, 0*3 is 0, 0*3 is 0, and 9*3 is 27. So, 12000 + 0 + 0 + 27 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to make sure. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3("" parts. Each ""3("" corresponds to a layer. Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 9 layers? But in my earlier calculation, I only went up to the eighth layer. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the ninth layer would be 3*(1 + 12027). Let me compute that: 1 + 12027 = 12028. Then 3*12028. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*12028: 10000*3 = 30000, 2000*3 = 6000, 20*3 = 60, 8*3 = 24. Adding those together: 30000 + 6000 = 36000, plus 60 is 36060, plus 24 is 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. Total: 300+120=420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 20*3=60, 8*3=24. 30000+6000=36000+60=36060+24=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so each step seems correct. So the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something recursive. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, if I denote the nth term as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, we have a recursive formula here. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, can we find a closed-form formula for a_n? <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: C = 3 + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3*C = 3 => -2*C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (11*729 - 9)/6 = (8019 - 9)/6 = 8010/6 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (11*2187 - 9)/6 = (24057 - 9)/6 = 24048/6 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (11*6561 - 9)/6 = (72171 - 9)/6 = 72162/6 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (11*19683 - 9)/6 = (216513 - 9)/6 = 216504/6 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the value of the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each term is 3 more than three times the previous term. It's similar to a geometric progression, but with an added constant each time. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, through step-by-step computation and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost part and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(3 \times (1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\). <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the entire expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it'll make more sense. So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I'm tracking this correctly. The innermost part is the last set of parentheses: 1 + 3. So, replacing that with 4, the next layer is 1 + 3(1 + 3). Hmm, no, wait. Let me look again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 times the next layer). So, maybe I should work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers to keep track. Let's say the innermost layer is Layer 1: 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 3*(Layer 1 + 1). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Hmm, maybe I need to define it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a term. Let's say Layer 1 is 1 + 3. Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. There are 9 opening parentheses, so 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing Layer 9 as 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*29524. 3*29000 = 87000, and 3*524 = 1572.

Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is following a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the innermost layer, a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>n=4: a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>n=5: a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>n=6: a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>n=7: a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>n=8: a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>n=9: a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with what I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, and it can be solved. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution and the particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A = 1 + 3A => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches what I got earlier. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I did it both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence relation, and both methods gave me the same answer.

Because each time, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, if I start from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(innermost)). <nEwLiNe>So, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost, and L9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 1 + 3*(L1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*(L2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*(L3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(L9). Because the outermost layer is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, we have to multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me do it digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 *3 = 88572. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on. Let me double-check my earlier steps because 88572 seems a bit high, but considering the number of layers, maybe it's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers. Maybe I miscounted how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and each layer is multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I considered L1 to L9, each being 1 + 3*(previous), but actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>First: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. So, let me see if I can find a formula for such a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>We can find A and B using initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the equation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 <nEwLiNe>So, a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, as before. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have kept computing each layer step by step until the ninth layer, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But recognizing the recurrence relation and solving it was a smarter approach, saving time from computing each layer manually. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. Compute each subsequent layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   \begin{align*} <nEwLiNe>   L1 & : 1 + 3 = 4 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L2 & : 1 + 3 \times 4 = 13 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L3 & : 1 + 3 \times 13 = 40 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L4 & : 1 + 3 \times 40 = 121 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L5 & : 1 + 3 \times 121 = 364 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L6 & : 1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L7 & : 1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L8 & : 1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841 \\ <nEwLiNe>   L9 & : 1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524 \\ <nEwLiNe>   \end{align*} <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. The outermost layer is 3 times the result of the ninth layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, the innermost part is the last (1 + 3), right? <nEwLiNe>Let me number the parentheses from the inside out to keep track: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost one. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, actually, there are nine sets of parentheses. Let me count: starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). So, it's like 3 layers deep, but with nine sets? Wait, no. Let me check the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3, then multiplied by 3, and so on. It seems like each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, it's a repeated multiplication by 3 after adding 1 and 3 each time. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can represent this as a recursive sequence? Let me define each layer as a term in a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5=15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 +15)=3*16=48. Hmm, is that right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the innermost expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say the innermost expression is E₁ = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, E₂ = 1 + 3*E₁. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), which is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, then 3*(1 + 48) = 147, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3). Hmm, perhaps it's 9 layers? Wait, no, let me count the number of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then inside it, another 3, and so on. Each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then, each layer out adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3s before the innermost (1 + 3). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>From the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), then inside that, another 3, and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3s are there? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>10. 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3 followed by nine instances of (1 + 3(...)), but each time the nesting increases by one. Wait, perhaps it's 9 layers? Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is layer 1, then layer 2, up to layer 9. So, nine layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the number of opening parentheses. Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), that's layer 1, then each time we go outward, we add another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))). So, how many times does 3*(1 + ... ) occur? Let me count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>From the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting with the first 3, then each time another 3 inside. So, the first 3 is followed by 9 nested 3s. Wait, actually, let's count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>1. 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 <nEwLiNe>3. 3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 <nEwLiNe>5. 3 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 <nEwLiNe>7. 3 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 <nEwLiNe>9. 3 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 10 threes? Hmm, no, actually, the expression is 3 followed by nine more 3s, each nested inside. So, the total number of layers is 9. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's denote: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a₂ = 3*(1 + a₁) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 3*(1 + a₂) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 3*(1 + a₃) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 3*(1 + a₄) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 3*(1 + a₅) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 3*(1 + a₆) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 3*(1 + a₇) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 3*(1 + a₈) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if we have nine layers, then the final result is 36084? But let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from a₁ as the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then a₂ is the next layer, up to a₉ as the outermost. So, yes, nine layers in total. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm by counting the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>Each (1 + 3(...) is a new layer. So, starting from the first (1 + 3(...)), that's one, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...) is another. So, how many (1 + 3(...) are there? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, nine layers, each being (1 + 3(...)). So, starting from a₁ as the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then a₂, up to a₉, which is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, according to my earlier calculation, a₉ is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 3*(1 + a₁) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? It seems like a geometric progression or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Each term is aₙ = 3*(1 + aₙ₋₁). So, aₙ = 3 + 3*aₙ₋₁. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is aₙ = 3*aₙ₋₁ + 3, with a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation: aₙ - 3*aₙ₋₁ = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say aₙ = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3 => C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is aₙ = A*3ⁿ - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>a₁ = A*3¹ - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is aₙ = (11/6)*3ⁿ - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>aₙ = (11/6)*3ⁿ - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write 3ⁿ as 3ⁿ, so let's compute a₉: <nEwLiNe>a₉ = (11/6)*3⁹ - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3⁹: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉ = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 19683 / 6: 19683 ÷ 6 = 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3280.5 * 10 = 32805, plus 3280.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉ = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches my earlier result. So, the value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6. <nEwLiNe>19683 ÷ 3 = 6561, so 19683 = 3*6561. <nEwLiNe>So, (11 * 3 * 6561)/6 = (33 * 6561)/6. <nEwLiNe>33/6 = 5.5, so 5.5 * 6561. <nEwLiNe>5 * 6561 = 32805. <nEwLiNe>0.5 * 6561 = 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Adding them: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can recognize that each term is 3*(previous term + 1). So, aₙ = 3*(aₙ₋₁ + 1). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a₁ = 4, the terms go 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost part and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>Define a sequence \(a_n\) where each term is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost term is \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>- Each subsequent term is defined by \(a_n = 3 \times (1 + a_{n-1})\). <nEwLiNe>We compute the terms step by step: <nEwLiNe>- \(a_1 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_2 = 3 \times (1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_3 = 3 \times (1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_4 = 3 \times (1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_5 = 3 \times (1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_6 = 3 \times (1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_7 = 3 \times (1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_8 = 3 \times (1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>- \(a_9 = 3 \times (1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: 1 + 3. So, let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Hmm, that's the next layer. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. Got it. So, the next layer simplifies to 13. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(13). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, that layer simplifies to 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3(40). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that's 121. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Hmm, 3 times 121 is... let me see, 120 times 3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems a bit large, but okay, let's keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(364). Calculating 3 times 364. Hmm, 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Whoa, that's a big number! But let's proceed. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(1093). Calculating 3 times 1093. Let's break it down: 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Wow, this is getting huge. I wonder how many layers there are. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's seven layers so far. Let me check the original expression again to make sure I haven't missed any. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is an additional 1 + 3(...). So, let's count the number of parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the number of opening parentheses is 9, so there are 9 layers? Wait, no, maybe 8 layers. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, starting from the first 3(, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So, each time, we have 1 + 3(...), and each time, the innermost is one more 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let's count how many times we have 1 + 3(...). Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until we reach the outermost. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis after the first 3( is another layer. So, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 1 + 3(...) is 8. Because starting from the innermost, each layer is one more. So, innermost is 1 + 3, then next is 1 + 3(1 + 3), and so on, up to 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed earlier, I only got to 7 layers. Hmm, maybe I missed one. Let's recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(3280) = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, there are 8 layers. I think I stopped one layer too early. <nEwLiNe>So, proceeding: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(3280). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280: 3000 * 3 = 9000, 280 * 3 = 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the 8th layer, which simplifies to 9841. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 times that result. So, the outermost operation is 3(9841). <nEwLiNe>So, 3 times 9841. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 9000 * 3 = 27000, 800 * 3 = 2400, 40 * 3 = 120, 1 * 3 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>3 * 9841: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>1 * 3 = 3 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's 9 layers? Or is the outermost 3( ) the 9th operation? Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 times the result of the inner expression. So, the inner expression has 8 layers of 1 + 3(...), and then the outermost is 3 times that. So, in total, 9 operations. <nEwLiNe>But when I was counting earlier, I had 8 layers, which resulted in 9841, and then multiplied by 3 to get 29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a function f(n) where each layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(8) = 3*9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is f(n) = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, equating both sides: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 <nEwLiNe>So, B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form formula is f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with the earlier results. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: f(1) = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: f(2) = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: f(3) = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: f(4) = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: f(5)=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: f(6)=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: f(7)=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: f(8)=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the closed-form formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(8) = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(8) = 3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to express the entire original expression in terms of the closed-form, it's 3*( (3^{8+1} -1)/2 ) = 3*( (3^9 -1)/2 ) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*( (19683 -1)/2 )= 3*(19682/2)=3*9841=29523. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 29523. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will make more sense. So, let's see. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Then each subsequent layer wraps that result in another 3 times (1 + ...). So, perhaps I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. So, starting with layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the final result is 36,084?

Maybe I can think of this as a geometric series or something? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as L_n, then L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation seems similar to something I might have seen before. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a linear recurrence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is L_n^h = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume L_n^p = B. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: B = 3 + 3*B => B - 3*B = 3 => -2B = 3 => B = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition L_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 3/2 => 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: (11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, which is the outermost layer: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result as before. So that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 3.

Layer 7: \(3 \times (1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: \(3 \times (1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: \(3 \times (1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, let's see... The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, that result is multiplied by 3, and added to 1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out layer by layer: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3(4). Wait, that would be 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3(13). Hmm, 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3(40). 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Then: 1 + 3(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3(364). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Then: 1 + 3(1093). Let's calculate 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3(9841). Calculating 3*9841: 9841*3, let's see, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, +120 = 29520, +3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Hmm, 29524*3. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524*3: <nEwLiNe>- 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding those up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times that entire expression, right? Wait no, looking back, the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the first (1 + 3(...)). So, in my step-by-step above, I computed the innermost part first, then each subsequent layer, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the final result I got was 88573. But wait, is that the final answer? Or is there another multiplication by 3? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>It's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )). <nEwLiNe>So, each time, except for the outermost 3, the structure is 1 + 3*(something). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Then, the entire expression is 3*(the result of all those layers). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something). The something is 1 + 3*(something else). So, in my calculation, I was computing from the innermost, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous). So, when I reached the outermost layer, I had 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, but then that entire thing is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the original expression, the first 3 is multiplying the first (1 + ...). So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1+"" is followed by a 3(...). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each subsequent is 1+3*(previous). Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 1+3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1+3(1+3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each time, starting from the innermost, we have 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, let me count the number of ""1+"" sections. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: 1+3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each time it's 1+3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9? Because each ""1+"" is a new layer, except the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of times ""1+"" appears. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: starting after the first 3, we have 1+3(...). Then, each subsequent layer is 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, and moving out, each layer is another 1+3(...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ( after 1+3 is a new layer. So, starting from the first ( after 1+3, that's the first layer. Then each subsequent ( adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe another approach: the number of times ""1+"" occurs is 9, because each layer is a ""1+"" followed by a ""3(...)"". So, starting from the innermost, 1+3, then 1+3(...), etc., up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of ""1+"" in the expression: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1+"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", so let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1+3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside, another 1+3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many times does ""1+"" appear? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: 1+3. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer adds another 1+3(...). So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers: the innermost is 1+3, then each previous layer adds another 1+3(...). So, the number of ""1+"" is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from 1+3. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute the value, we need to compute each layer from the innermost to the outermost, and then multiply the final result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first multiplication by 3 is after all the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, the first layer is 1 + 3, the second layer is 1 + 3*(first layer), the third layer is 1 + 3*(second layer), etc., up to 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(ninth layer). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I went one step further, computing 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, but that would be if the outermost operation was 1 + 3*(...). But in reality, the outermost operation is 3*(...). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>So, we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I was computing step by step, I thought I had 88,573, but that was because I mistakenly included an extra 1 + 3*(...) layer, which doesn't exist. The original expression only has 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) and then the outermost 3*. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct final answer should be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1,093 = 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3,280 = 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9,841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, this expression resembles a geometric series, but with each term being multiplied by 3 and added 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's similar to the expansion of (3^n - 1)/2, but let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's think recursively. Let’s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, computing a_1 to a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1,093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1,093 = 3,280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3,280 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9,841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Then, total = 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, noticing that each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. <nEwLiNe>So, equating LHS and RHS: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B. <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B. <nEwLiNe>Then, -2B = 1 => B = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2,187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59,049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression = 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid.

Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward.

Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recap all the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each step was multiplying by 3 and adding 1: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right. Each step, I took the innermost expression, computed it, then moved outward, replacing each layer step by step. I think this method is correct because each parentheses is dependent on the next, so working from the inside ensures that each substitution is accurate. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series or a recursive function, but given the depth is only 9 layers, computing each step manually is feasible. <nEwLiNe>Just to confirm, perhaps I can write a small table of each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, 10 steps, starting from the innermost. Each step is straightforward, just multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Another way to look at it is recognizing a pattern. If I let a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so this recursive approach confirms the same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I try to find a closed-form formula for a_n, maybe I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume a_p is constant, so a_p = 3*a_p + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9 (since we have 9 layers after the initial 1 + 3), a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1 = 3; 3^2 = 9; 3^3 = 27; 3^4 = 81; 3^5 = 243; 3^6 = 729; 3^7 = 2187; 3^8 = 6561; 3^9 = 19683; 3^{10} = 59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, using the recurrence relation method also leads us to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could have continued computing each step as I did initially, and it would have been time-consuming but reliable. <nEwLiNe>In any case, after computing each layer step by step, verifying through different methods (step-by-step computation, recurrence relation), I arrive at the same answer: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work outward. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually makes sense with nested parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, let's rewrite the expression for clarity: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, I notice that each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). It seems like each layer is the same structure but with fewer nested expressions. Let me count how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3(innermost result) <nEwLiNe>3. Then the next one: 1 + 3(previous result) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>It goes on until there are 9 layers. So, this is a 9-level nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Maybe I can represent each layer as a function or a term. Let me denote each layer as \( a_n \), where n is the number of layers from the inside. So, the innermost is \( a_1 = 1 + 3 \), then \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \), \( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 \), and so on, up to \( a_9 \). The entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each \( a_n \) step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with \( a_1 \): <nEwLiNe>\( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \) <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \) <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \) <nEwLiNe>Proceeding to \( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \) <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \) <nEwLiNe>Continuing, \( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \) <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \) <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \) <nEwLiNe>Finally, \( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \) <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \), which is 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the digits.

Maybe better to compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15+2=17, write 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+1=7. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. Hmm, yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 29524 * 3: 29524 is approximately 30,000, so 3*30,000=90,000, so 88,572 is a bit less than that, which makes sense. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check each \( a_n \) step to make sure I didn't make an error in the recursive computation. <nEwLiNe>Starting with \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>\( a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>\( a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>\( a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \).

Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all the \( a_n \) steps are correct, leading to \( a_9 = 29524 \). Then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. So, that seems solid. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such recursive expressions? Maybe a geometric series or something? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each \( a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \). This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is \( a_n = A \cdot 3^n + B \), where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \), with \( a_1 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: \( a_n^{(h)} = C \cdot 3^n \). <nEwLiNe>Find a particular solution.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: \( a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: \( a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=4: \( a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2=242/2=121 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Thus, \( a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 \). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \). Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * a_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the answer.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will make more sense. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3.

Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...*(1 + 3)...))), with nine 1 + 3 layers inside. <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and there are nine such layers inside the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if I compute a_1 to a_9, where a_1 is innermost, a_9 is the outermost before multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1 to a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive sequence. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is homogeneous + particular. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) = 3A - 1/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for a_9, we have n = 9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps we can see the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, using the formula, if we consider the entire expression as E, then E = 3*(1 + 3*(...)), but since there are nine layers, it's a bit more involved. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in our earlier approach, we treated each layer as a_n, starting from the innermost. So, with nine layers, a_9 is the value before the outermost multiplication by 3. So, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>But, using the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then E = 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if we think of the entire expression as starting with the outermost 3, then perhaps it's a different indexing. But in this case, since the innermost is 1 + 3, and we have nine layers, it's safer to stick with our previous approach. <nEwLiNe>So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier: <nEwLiNe>Compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say the result is 88,572. The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it'll be easier. Let's see, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? So let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So each time, we take the previous result, multiply it by 3, add 1, and then use that in the next layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let me write this down step by step: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards: <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Hmm, maybe I misread it earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So perhaps my initial step was wrong. Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: Let's call it L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, the next layer is 3*(1 + L1). Wait, is that right? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So yes, each layer is 3*(1 + inner layer). So the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, so perhaps L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, L3 would be 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So let's see, how many layers do we have here? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: starting from 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Let me count the number of 3's. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So each ""3("" is a layer. Let's count the number of 3's. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let me count: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So from the first 3, each 3 adds a layer, so how many layers? <nEwLiNe>First layer: 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) <nEwLiNe>And so on. Let's count the number of 3's after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So after the first 3, there are 8 more 3's, each starting a new layer. Wait, actually, let's see: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each ""..."" has another 3. So how many 3's are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3 and another parenthesis. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So the number of 3's is 9. Let me check: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the initial 3 is the first layer, then each subsequent 3 is a deeper layer. So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the ninth layer? Or is it the eighth? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to write each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as L1, then each layer wraps around it with 3*(1 + L_previous). So starting from L1: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, if I'm not mistaken, starting from L1 as 4, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So after 9 layers, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds another layer. Let's count the number of 3's inside: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers in total. So from L1 to L9, as I computed above, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result should be 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive expression? It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. Each layer is defined by L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L_n = 3*L_{n-1} + 3, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So homogeneous solution: L_n^h = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2A = 3 => A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is L_n = L_n^h + L_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: L_1 = C*3^1 - 3/2 = 3C - 3/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 <nEwLiNe>C = 11/(2*3) = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3) <nEwLiNe>Now, we need L_9. <nEwLiNe>So, plug n=9: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (1/2)*(11*3^{8} - 3) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (1/2)*(11*6561 - 3) = (1/2)*(72171 - 3) = (1/2)*72168 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. So, that's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1.

Okay, let me see. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3.

So, how many times does ""3("" occur? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the first 3( is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 3( is layer 2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, layer 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, which is at the end, so layer 10 would be 1 + 3, then layer 9 is 1 + 3*(layer10), and so on until layer1 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, layer10: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. So, the outermost layer is Layer1: 1 + 3*(Layer2 result). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(... So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer2 result). Hmm, I might have miscounted earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... So, the very first operation is 3*(... So, the outermost is 3*(... So, perhaps my layers are misnumbered. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should think of it as: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as a sequence. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>But actually, looking at the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... So, it's 3 times a term that is 1 plus 3 times another term, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think recursively. Let me define f(n) as the expression with n layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, f(1) would be 1 + 3, which is 4. Then f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Wait, but in our earlier step-by-step, starting from the innermost, we had 4, 13, 40, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile this. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong because I thought the outermost is 3*(... but actually, it's 3*(1 + 3*(... So, the outermost is 3*(1 + ... So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... So, the first operation is 3*(...

Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 24 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 3*(20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) = 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 <nEwLiNe>Compute each: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should compute 3*29524 directly. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*       3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let me recount the layers. <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, that's layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, layer2: 13, layer3:40,... up to layer9:29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for f(n). Since f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 1, with f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is homogeneous solution + particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve homogeneous equation: f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The solution is f(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the equation: A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition: f(1) = 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(9) = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, f(9) = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*f(9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula, f(n) = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, f(9) = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Then, 3*f(9) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1.

17,88572,1,15,406,"
Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. So, let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*(First layer) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the second layer simplifies to 13. Moving out another layer, we have another 1 + 3 times this new result: <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*(Second layer) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's 40. Let's keep going: <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 1 + 3*(Third layer) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 3*(Fourth layer) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that. 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Yeah, that's right. <nEwLiNe>Moving on: <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 1 + 3*(Fifth layer) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 3*(Sixth layer) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*(Seventh layer) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*(Eighth layer) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication or addition here. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093. 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 3279 + 1 is 3280. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000+840=9840. Then 9840 +1=9841. Okay, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then add 1: 29523 +1 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the ninth layer simplifies to 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this ninth layer result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ... )). So, after the ninth layer, which is the innermost, we have the outermost multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final step is: 3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Calculating 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me verify my calculations once more to be sure. It's easy to make a multiplication error with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>No more digits, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits: 7 7 7 5 7 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me write it out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524: <nEwLiNe>Digits: 2 9 5 2 4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 is: <nEwLiNe>From right to left: 4, 2, 5, 9, 2. <nEwLiNe>So, let's do the multiplication: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12: write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7: write down 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15: write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28: write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8: write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together from right to left: 2,7,5,8,8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 88572. So, yes, 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. Let me just recount the layers to make sure I didn't skip any or count incorrectly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 =4 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous result). So: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's nine layers inside, and then the outermost multiplication by 3. So, nine layers inside, starting from 1+3, then each time building up. <nEwLiNe>I think that's right. It might help to think of this as a geometric series or something, but with the way it's nested, each term is 1 + 3*previous, which is similar to a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model it as a recursive function. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1+39=40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to f(9)=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then the total expression is 3*f(9)=88572 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution: f(n) - 3*f(n-1) =1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is f(n) - 3f(n-1) = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 =0, so r=3. So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C - 3*C =1 => -2C=1 => C= -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is f(n)= A*3^n -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4= A*3^1 -1/2 => 4= 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2= 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is f(n)= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, f(n)= (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula for n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81-1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, f(9)= (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, f(9)= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost multiplication is 3*29524=88572, as before. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could compute 3^{10}=59049, then 59049 -1=59048, divided by 2 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Either way, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense. So, let me write it out more clearly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving to the next layer: 1 + 12. That's 13. Then, 3 times 13 is 39. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 39. That equals 40. Multiply by 3: 120. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward: 1 + 120 is 121. Multiply by 3: 363. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 363 is 364. Multiply by 3: 1092. <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 1092 is 1093. Multiply by 3: 3279. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3279 is 3280. Multiply by 3: 9840. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I missed a step or miscalculated somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I messed up the first step earlier. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). <nEwLiNe>So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, perhaps I need to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define it recursively. Let me denote each layer as a function. Let's say a_n represents the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has nine layers. Let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to nine layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my initial count was off. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, that's the outermost layer. Then each subsequent 3( adds a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, nine layers in total. Therefore, we need to compute a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so a_1 is the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, is 36084 the correct answer? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify each step again to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a pattern or formula that can be used to compute this without manually calculating each layer? Maybe a recursive formula or a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the sequence of a_n: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at the pattern, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, rewrite the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2 => 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>19683*10 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>19683*1 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Total: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps better to compute 216,504 / 6: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 2 is 0, 6 into 21 is 3, 3*6=18, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 0: 50. <nEwLiNe>6 into 50 is 8, 8*6=48, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24. <nEwLiNe>6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking again, each layer is 3 times (1 plus the next layer). Let me make sure I parse this correctly. <nEwLiNe>The structure is like this: 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next expression). So, starting from the innermost, let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from inside out: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer, right? So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer wraps around that.

How many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) – that's the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...

So, it's a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). It might form a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. If I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n+1} = 1 + 3*a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, recursively, a_1 = 4, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_{n+1} = 3*a_n + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_{n+1} - 3a_n = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution: a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Plug into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: a_1 = A*3^1 - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, the outermost layer, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the result we got earlier for Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms that the result is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since the expression is 3*(a_9), and a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10} is 59049, so 59049 - 1 = 59048. <nEwLiNe>59048 / 2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations, and the recurrence relation method cross-verifies the result. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost layer and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the next layer out is 3 times that result. Let me write that down. <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + ...). The ... here is the previous result, which was 12. So, 1 + 12. <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply that by 3 again: 3 * 13. <nEwLiNe>3 * 13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next layer is (1 + 39). So, 1 + 39. <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: (1 + 120) = 121. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363. <nEwLiNe>Next: (1 + 363) = 364. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092. <nEwLiNe>Next: (1 + 1092) = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279. <nEwLiNe>Next: (1 + 3279) = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840. <nEwLiNe>Next: (1 + 9840) = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me check how many layers we're dealing with here. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time, we're moving one layer out. Let me count the number of multiplications by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 =12 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 12)=3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 +39)=3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 +120)=3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 +363)=3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 +1092)=3*1093=3279 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 +3279)=3*3280=9840 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 +9840)=3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 +29523)=3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I think I miscounted earlier. There are 9 layers, so we need to do 9 multiplications by 3. Let me go through each step carefully: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 12 =13; 3 *13=39 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 +39=40; 3 *40=120 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1 +120=121; 3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:1 +363=364; 3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1 +1092=1093; 3*1093=3279 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:1 +3279=3280; 3*3280=9840 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1 +9840=9841; 3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally:1 +29523=29524; 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. So, the number of 3* operations is 9? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Looking back: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" is an opening. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 opening parentheses. So, that means 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3. So, the computation steps are 9, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my earlier calculation, I went through 9 layers, but each time, I had to compute (1 + previous result) and then multiply by 3. So, it's 9 layers, each time doing two operations: add 1, multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier count, I listed 10 steps because I included the final result after the 9th multiplication. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 =12 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, that's only 5 layers. But we have 9 layers. Hmm, I must have miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recursive formula. Let me define a sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, the innermost expression is (1 + 3). So, maybe a_1 =1 +3=4, then a_2=3*(1 +a_1)=3*(1 +4)=15? Wait, no, that doesn't fit. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Let me label the innermost expression as the first step: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 3*(1 + Step1) =3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my original computation, I had 3*(1 +3)=12 as Step2. Hmm, perhaps I need to be more precise. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15. Then, moving out another layer, it's 3*(1 +15)=48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought of each layer as first adding 1 and then multiplying by 3, but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>But how many times does this happen? Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3*(1 + "" is a term in the recurrence. Let's count the number of ""3*("". <nEwLiNe>From the expression: starting after the first 3*, we have 8 more 3*. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's count the number of opening parentheses: each ""("" corresponds to a new layer. <nEwLiNe>From the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 9 opening parentheses, meaning 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 3 (the innermost 3), then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), and so on up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, the innermost is (1 +3), which is 4, so maybe a_1=4, a_2=3*(1 +a_1)=15, a_3=3*(1 +a_2)=48, etc., up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>But let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8), where a_8 =3*(1 +a_7), and so on, down to a_1 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the innermost is (1 +3)=4, so maybe a_1=4, then a_2=3*(1 +a_1)=15, a_3=3*(1 +a_2)=48, a_4=3*(1 +a_3)=147, a_5=3*(1 +a_4)=444, a_6=3*(1 +a_5)=1335, a_7=3*(1 +a_6)=4008, a_8=3*(1 +a_7)=12027, a_9=3*(1 +a_8)=36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this seems different from my initial computation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 +3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +147)=444. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +444)=1335. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +1335)=4008. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +4008)=12027. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +12027)=36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I got 88572. Hmm, that's inconsistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3*("" in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial computation, I had 9 layers, but I think I added an extra layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3*("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 +3 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers. So, each ""3*("" corresponds to a layer. So, the innermost is (1 +3)=4, then layer 2 is 3*(1 +4)=15, layer 3 is 3*(1 +15)=48, etc., up to layer 9: 3*(1 +12027)=36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer should be 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought it was 88572, which was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 3*(1 +a1)=3*(4)=12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that contradicts the earlier approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's think of it as starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Then: 3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers, starting from (1 +3)=4, then each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let's verify this with a smaller number of layers to see if the pattern holds. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have just 1 layer: 3*(1 +3)=12. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>2 layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>3 layers:3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=39? Wait, no, wait. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, with 2 layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3))=3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>With 3 layers: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*4)=3*(1 +12)=39? Wait, that can't be. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that's not right. Let's compute 3 layers properly: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Outermost layer:3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>So, 3 layers give 48. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, 4 layers:3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so each layer adds a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>So, 1 layer:12 <nEwLiNe>2 layers:39 <nEwLiNe>3 layers:120 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait. <nEwLiNe>Wait, confusion arises because depending on how you count layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the number of multiplications by 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""3*"" is a multiplication, so the number of multiplications is equal to the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>So, if we have 9 ""3*"", then we have 9 multiplications. <nEwLiNe>But in reality, the expression is 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(...))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps the formula is a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, this is similar to a geometric sequence where each term is 3 + 3*previous term. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, it's a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, the innermost is (1 +3)=4, so perhaps a_1=4, then a_2=3*(1 +a_1)=15, a_3=3*(1 +a_2)=48, etc. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so a_1=4, a_2=15, a_3=48, a_4=147, a_5=444, a_6=1335, a_7=4008, a_8=12027, a_9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me check with n=1: a1=4 <nEwLiNe>n=2:3*(1+4)=15 <nEwLiNe>n=3:3*(1+15)=48 <nEwLiNe>n=4:3*(1+48)=147 <nEwLiNe>n=5:3*(1+147)=444 <nEwLiNe>n=6:3*(1+444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>n=7:3*(1+1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>n=8:3*(1+4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>n=9:3*(1+12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so for each n, a_n=3*(1 +a_{n-1}), starting from a1=4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after 9 layers, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I thought I had 88572, but that was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's see if there's a formula for this recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 +a_{n-1}), with a1=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve it as follows: <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c + r*a_{n-1}, where c=3, r=3. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n = 3a_{n-1}, whose solution is a_n = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 3 => -2K=3 => K= -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a1=4. <nEwLiNe>When n=1: a1=4= A*3^1 -3/2 => 4=3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>3A =4 + 3/2=5.5=11/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A= (11/2)/3=11/6 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n= (11/6)*3^n -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n= (11/6)*3^n -3/2= (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>But let's compute a9: <nEwLiNe>a9= (11/6)*3^9 -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>So, a9= (11/6)*19683 -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 /6= 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 *11= Let's compute: <nEwLiNe>3280 *11=36080 <nEwLiNe>0.5 *11=5.5 <nEwLiNe>So total=36080 +5.5=36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3/2=1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 -1.5=36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so a9=36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought I had 88572, which was wrong. So, the correct answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Let me just confirm once more by stepping through each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2:3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3:3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4:3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5:3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6:3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7:3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8:3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9:3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 36084. The expression is computed by recursively evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer involves adding 1 to the result of the previous layer and then multiplying by 3. After evaluating all nine layers, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
