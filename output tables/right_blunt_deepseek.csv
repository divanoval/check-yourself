 But wait, let's verify this step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: 3 × 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>3. Add 1: 12 + 1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3 × 13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>5. Add 1: 39 + 1 = 40. <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3 × 40 = 120. <nEwLiNe>7. Add 1: 120 + 1 = 121. <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3 × 121 = 363. <nEwLiNe>9. Add 1: 363 + 1 = 364. <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3 × 364 = 1092. <nEwLiNe>11. Add 1: 1092 + 1 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 3 × 1093 = 3279. <nEwLiNe>13. Add 1: 3279 + 1 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3 × 3280 = 9840. <nEwLiNe>15. Add 1: 9840 + 1 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 3 × 9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>17. Add 1: 29523 + 1 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 3 × 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression step by step, we'll start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outward. The given expression is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>1. **Innermost Parentheses:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>5. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>6. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>7. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>8. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>9. **Outermost Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>10. **Final Layer:** <nEwLiNe>    \[ <nEwLiNe>    3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>    \] <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 But I need to know how to get there. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. But I think I can break it down step by step. Let me try to figure this out. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another similar expression. It seems like a recursive pattern. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, let's rewrite the expression to see the structure better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, it's like a chain of operations. Maybe I can compute each level one by one, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me label each level from the inside out as Level 1 to Level 9. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost expression is Level 1, which is 1 + 3, right? Then each subsequent level adds another layer around it. So, let me compute Level 1 first. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving to Level 2, which is 1 + 3*(Level 1). Since Level 1 is 4, this becomes: <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, Level 2 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next, Level 3 is 1 + 3*(Level 2). Level 2 is 13, so: <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Alright, Level 3 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3). Level 3 is 40: <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 4 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4). Level 4 is 121: <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 5 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5). Level 5 is 364: <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 6 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6). Level 6 is 1093: <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 7 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7). Level 7 is 3280: <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 8 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8). Level 8 is 9841: <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Level 9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. But the original expression is 3 multiplied by (Level 9). Because the entire expression is 3*(...). So, after computing Level 9 as 29524, we need to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x     3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 multiplied by 3 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. Let me check each multiplication step. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*4=12, 1+12=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*13=39, 1+39=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*40=120, 1+120=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*121=363, 1+363=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*364=1092, 1+1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*1093=3279, 1+3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*3280=9840, 1+9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*9841=29523, 1+29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let's compute 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought the answer was 88,572, but when I started, the user said ""The answer is 88572."" Wait, that's the same number, just without the comma. So, 88572 is the same as 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my computation seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula to compute this without calculating each level step by step. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>This expression is of the form: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... + 3(1 + 3))...))) <nEwLiNe>Which is a nested expression with 9 levels of nesting. Each level is of the form 1 + 3*(next level). <nEwLiNe>This resembles a geometric series but in a nested form. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. The general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each level n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for Level 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to compute it using the recurrence relation and solving it with the formula. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could have noticed the pattern in the a_n values: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 = (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 121. <nEwLiNe>So, yeah, the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, and multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another method to reach the same answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a sum of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>But given the nested structure, it's a bit different. The expression can be considered as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I let S be the entire expression, then S = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>But actually, the inner expression is similar to S/3, because S = 3*(inner expression). So, maybe S = 3*(1 + 3*(inner expression)). <nEwLiNe>But the inner expression is similar to S/3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to model it. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as S_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1. <nEwLiNe>S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to S_9. <nEwLiNe>So, each S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Which is exactly the same recurrence as before. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the formula still holds. <nEwLiNe>So, regardless of the method, I end up with the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 But I need to explain how to get there step by step. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and 3s. Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each set of parentheses depends on the one inside it. So, let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so now I can replace the innermost parentheses with 4. Let me rewrite the expression with that in mind: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, since there are nine sets of parentheses, maybe I should number them from the innermost to the outermost to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each level as Level 1 to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, Level 2: (1 + 3(Level 1)) <nEwLiNe>Which is (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Hold on, let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving on to Level 3: (1 + 3*(Level 2)) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*13: 39 <nEwLiNe>So, Level 3: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: (1 + 3*(Level 3)) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*40: 120 <nEwLiNe>So, Level 4: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: (1 + 3*(Level 4)) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*121: 363 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: (1 + 3*(Level 5)) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12, so 900+180=1080 +12=1092 <nEwLiNe>So, Level 6: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: (1 + 3*(Level 6)) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9; so 3000+270=3270 +9=3279 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: (1 + 3*(Level 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840; so 9000+840=9840 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: (1 + 3*(Level 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841: Let's break it down. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but the original expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses, which is Level 9. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: Let's do 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations because the final answer is 88572, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Level 1: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524*3 again: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>------ <nEwLiNe>29524*3: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct.

 But how? <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a recursive expression where each term is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is repeated multiple times. It starts with 3(1 + 3(...)), and each time, inside the parentheses, it's another 3(1 + ...). So, it's like a chain of these operations. Let me count how many times this happens. Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 3 times that result: 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Then, 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>4. Repeat this process until we go through all the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each step seems to be of the form 3*(1 + previous expression). So maybe it's a repeated multiplication and addition. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to parse it from the inside out. The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one level out, we have 3*(1 + previous result). Wait, no, actually, looking back at the original expression, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So after the innermost 1 + 3 = 4, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3. Then each layer is 3*(1 + result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Let me denote each layer as E1, E2, ..., E9, where E1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>E1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2: 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>E3: 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>E4: 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>E5: 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>E6: 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>E7: 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>E8: 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>E9: 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. The outermost 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3( inside it: total 2 <nEwLiNe>3.

So, E1 to E9. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed up to E9, I got 36084, but the answer is supposed to be 88572. Hmm, so maybe I did something wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write out the layers step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me represent the expression as: <nEwLiNe>E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, E9 is 36084, but the answer is supposed to be 88572.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression is 3 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 8 layers, which would be a8 = 12027, but that's not 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is written as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 7 layers. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>No, still not. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))) with 10 layers. <nEwLiNe>a10 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>No. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is written differently, such as starting with 1 + 3*... instead of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try that. <nEwLiNe>If E = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), then E = 1 + 3*E, which would be E = (1)/(1 - 3) which is negative, which doesn't make sense. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that's a different approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is a continued fraction or something else. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I should consider that each layer is 3*(1 + previous), but the first layer is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then next is 3*(1 + 12) = 39, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try that. <nEwLiNe>E1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>E2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>E3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>E4: 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>E5: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Ah!

Since the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), it's better to consider E1 as 3*(1 + 3) = 12, and then build up from there. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by expanding each layer from the innermost outwards.

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a chain of 1s and 3s multiplied together. Let me try to figure out how to tackle this step by step.  <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, with each layer being 1 plus 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost part, each step is 1 + 3*(something). That something is another similar expression. It seems like a recursive structure. Maybe I can compute it from the inside and work my way outwards.  <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the structure to visualize it better. Let's denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost.  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until L9, since there are 9 layers of 1+3(...).

 But I need to see the step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is the last set of parentheses: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 3 times that result. Let me write it down: <nEwLiNe>3(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so actually, each layer is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner parentheses. So, maybe I should substitute each innermost parentheses step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>2. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 1)) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*4 first: 12 <nEwLiNe>Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that's 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: <nEwLiNe>3.

Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 3)) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 121. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>5. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 4)) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121: Let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, and 1*3 is 3, so 360 + 3 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Alright, 364. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>6. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 5)) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>3*364: Let's see, 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, 1080 + 12 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>So, 1093. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>7.

Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 7)) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9841. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>9. Compute (1 + 3*(result from step 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841: Let's compute that. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>29524. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>10.

Wait, actually, maybe a better way is to compute 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: Let me break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, that's not right. Wait, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Let me do it digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29,524 *3 is 88,572? Let me check with another method: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048 <nEwLiNe>59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Then, add 1: 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)). So, after computing step 9, we have 29,524. Then, step 10 is 1 + 3*29,524, which is 1 + 88,572 = 88,573. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original problem is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, after the innermost, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, actually, the first step is 1 + 3*4 = 13, then next is 1 + 3*13=40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I got to step 10, I was at the outermost layer, which is 3*(result from step 9). So, let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(previous) +1. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is 9. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(result from step 9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial counting, I went up to step 10, which was 88,573, but actually, the entire expression is 3*(step 9). So, step 9 gives 29,524, and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Ah, so the answer is 88,572, not 88,573. I think I added an extra 1 mistakenly. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, after 9 layers, we have 29,524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(29,524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>To recap: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, each step builds on the previous one, and after computing up to the 9th layer, we multiply by 3 to get the final answer. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. Let me just verify one of the steps to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>For example, step 5: 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121: 120*3=360, 1*3=3, so 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Another step, step 7: 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>As above, 29,524 *3: 29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048; 59,048 +29,524=88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all steps check out.

 But I need to see how to compute it step by step. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! I think I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. Let me count how many times the pattern repeats. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something).

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9000=27000, 3*800=2400, 3*41=123. So, 27000+2400=29400+123=29523. Then 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*29524.

 But how? <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Whoa, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. I remember that when dealing with nested parentheses, I should start from the innermost one and work my way out. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I notice that each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say the innermost part is Layer 1, then moving outward, Layer 2, up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>**Layer 1:** 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Okay, Layer 1 is simple: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>**Layer 2:** 3(Layer 1) = 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, Layer 2 is 3 multiplied by (1 + Layer 3). Hmm, no, maybe I need to correct that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is structured as 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define L1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L9. <nEwLiNe>But in the given expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...)))

Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, each expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression).

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Maybe I can work from the innermost part and expand each layer step by step. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, the innermost expression is 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13.

Next: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Hmm, but the expected answer is 88572. Wait, so maybe I miscounted the number of layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with 9 sets of parentheses. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the 9th layer. Then each subsequent layer adds one more computation. So, when I computed up to 88573, that should be the outermost layer. But the question is 3 times that, right? Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me re-examine the structure. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous result). So, in total, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) segments. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result of 1) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result of 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to count how many times we apply 3*(1 + ...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each time we go out, we add another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, right? Because each opening parenthesis is one layer. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed up to 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, that's the outermost layer. Then the entire expression is 3*(88573). Wait, no, because the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which was 3*(something). But wait, no, the initial expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the ... is the inner layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me parse the expression correctly. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). Therefore, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the layers are: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the innermost is layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. Then the entire expression is 3*(88573) = 265719. But the answer given is 88572, so I'm confused. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost layer. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result1) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the 9th layer. So, the 9th layer is 1 + 3*(result8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(result9). So, if I have 9 layers inside, and then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I compute up to result9 = 88573, then the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265719. But the answer is supposed to be 88572. Hmm, that doesn't match. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe the initial expression is 3*(result8). Let me see: the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 1 + 3, which is result1=4. Then result2=13, result3=40, result4=121, result5=364, result6=1093, result7=3280, result8=9841, result9=29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*result9) = 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>But the answer is 88572, which is exactly 3*29524. So, perhaps the expression is 3*(result9 -1). Wait, that doesn't make sense. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the expression again. Maybe I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9. <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Ah, I see! I think I miscounted earlier. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by L9, which is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. That's the answer. <nEwLiNe>So, my mistake earlier was thinking that L9 was 88573, but actually, L9 is 29524, and the entire expression is 3*L9, which is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Compute L1 to L9: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>I think I confused myself earlier by thinking that the outermost operation was another layer, but actually, the expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost layers, which is L9=29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous result. After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, which equals 29,524, the entire expression is 3 times this result, yielding 88,572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"
11,36084,0,14,11515,"
 But I need to explain how to get that. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together in a repetitive way. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up from the innermost parentheses outwards. So, maybe I should start by solving the innermost part and work my way out. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be done first. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(result of the innermost)). <nEwLiNe>3. And this pattern repeats until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me check: each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's like a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can model this as a sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. Let me define a sequence a_n where each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from some initial term. <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of times ""1 +"" appears. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a new term. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. ... until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each outer layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another 3*(1 + ...), and so on. So, let's count the number of times ""3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 times. So, does that mean there are 9 layers? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Yes, because each ""3("" adds a new layer. So, total layers are 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression can be represented as a recursive sequence with 9 terms. Let me define a_1, a_2, ..., a_9, where each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Actually, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check: <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), which would be a_10? Or is it a_9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me see. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is a_1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + a_8), which would be a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier calculation, a_9 is 36084. But the given answer is 88572. Hmm, so something's wrong here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), so that's one layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 3(1 + ...), so that's the second layer. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", so each ""3(...)"" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed up to a_9, I got 36084, but the answer is 88572. So, perhaps I need to go one more layer? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would be Layer1: 3*(1 + Layer2), Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer3), etc., up to Layer9: (1 + 3). So, total layers are 9, with the outermost being Layer1. <nEwLiNe>So, in my earlier calculation, a_1 = (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(5) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(16) = 48. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(49) = 147. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(148) = 444. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(445) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1336) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(4009) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(12028) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But the answer is 88572, so I must have missed a layer. Maybe the original expression has 10 layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count again. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is Layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, how many times does 3*(1 + ...) occur? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3( is at the very beginning. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside that, another 3(. <nEwLiNe>3. This continues until the innermost, which is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, let me count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first character: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" is: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( at the beginning. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside, 3(. <nEwLiNe>3. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 ""3(""s, meaning 9 layers. So, a_1 is the innermost, and a_9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>But according to my previous calculation, a_9 is 36084, but the answer is supposed to be 88572. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the sequence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try computing each layer step by step, maybe I messed up somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the outermost layer is 36084, but the answer is 88572. Hmm, so perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the original expression has more layers? Let me look again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 +"" inside: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", so the number of ""1 +"" is equal to the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Let's count the ""1 +"": <nEwLiNe>1. The first ""1 +"" is at the beginning: 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another ""1 +"": 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>3. This continues until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, how many ""1 +"" are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", and there are 9 instances of ""1 +"". So, that would mean 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But according to my calculation, a_9 is 36084, which doesn't match the given answer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the sequence. Maybe the outermost layer is 3*(1 + a_8), but in my calculation, a_9 is 3*(1 + a_8). So, if the original expression is 3*(1 + a_8), which is a_9, but according to my calculation, a_9 is 36084, but the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I must have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try calculating each layer again, step by step, more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, same result. So, unless I'm missing a layer, which I don't think I am, since there are 9 layers, but the answer is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the original expression has more layers. Let me check the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is Layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer.

So, why am I getting 36084, but the answer is 88572? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of ""3("" in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>That's 9 ""3(""s, so 9 layers. Therefore, the outermost layer is Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But the answer is 88572. So, perhaps the original expression has more layers, or I misapplied the sequence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the original expression has an extra layer I didn't count. Let me check again. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is Layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each ""3("" adds a layer. Let me count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3( is at the very start. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside, another 3(. <nEwLiNe>3. This continues until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, how many ""3("" are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" is: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>That's 9 ""3(""s, so 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the answer is 88572, which is exactly double of 44286. Hmm, 88572 divided by 2 is 44286, but I don't see where that number comes from. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sequence. Let me try calculating each layer again, but this time, perhaps I misapplied the formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, another approach: let's compute the expression from the innermost parentheses outwards, step by step. <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards: <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, same result. So, unless the original expression is different, I'm not getting 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the original expression has more layers. Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""1 + 3(...)"" layers. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", so let's count the number of ""1 +"": <nEwLiNe>1. The first ""1 +"" is at the beginning: 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another ""1 +"": 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>3. This continues until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, how many ""1 +"" are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" is followed by a ""3(...)"", and there are 9 instances of ""1 +"". So, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But the answer is 88572, which is different. So, perhaps there's a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check my calculations again, maybe I messed up somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so unless I'm missing something, the result should be 36084, but the given answer is 88572.

So, Layer2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, unless the original expression has one more layer, making it Layer10. <nEwLiNe>Let me assume that, even though the original expression seems to have 9 layers, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute Layer10: <nEwLiNe>Layer10: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>But that's still not 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me try a different approach: instead of counting ""3("", maybe I can count the number of closing parentheses. <nEwLiNe>But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the expression as a continued multiplication and see if there's a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Wait, another approach: notice that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if we denote a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, we can write a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>But solving this recurrence might help. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3*K. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But the given answer is 88,572, which is exactly double of 44,286, but 36,084 is not 44,286. Hmm, not sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to this, the result should be 36,084, not 88,572. So, perhaps the original expression was different, or the answer provided is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. Let me check again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1.

 But I need to see the step-by-step to understand. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It's written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. I think it's a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to parse this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I'll try to count how many layers there are. Let me see: starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many times does this happen? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1 + 3. Wait, maybe it's better to work from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression more clearly, maybe starting from the innermost part. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, right? Then each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So if I can compute each layer starting from the inside, I can work my way outwards. <nEwLiNe>Let me list the layers: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. Continue this until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So let's define each step: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., Ln, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me see how many layers there are. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times I see ""1 + 3("" before the first 1 + 3. Hmm, looking at the original expression, it's 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So how many times does ""1+3("" occur? Let's count: starting from the first 3(1+3(...), each subsequent layer adds another 1+3. So let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then each layer is 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. It's 9 opening parentheses, each corresponding to a layer. Wait, actually, each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>After the initial 3(1 + 3(..., each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each time wrapping another 1 + 3 around it. So how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many layers?

Let's count the number of 1+3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 (this is the innermost, Layer1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) (Layer2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) (Layer3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) (Layer4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) (Layer5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) (Layer6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) (Layer7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) (Layer8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) (Layer9) <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost 3(1 + ...) which wraps around Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...).

So the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Let me think if I can find a general formula for this kind of recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + C, where C is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Let me find C. <nEwLiNe>At steady state, a_n = a_{n-1} = C. <nEwLiNe>So C = 1 + 3*C ⇒ C - 3C = 1 ⇒ -2C = 1 ⇒ C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 ⇒ 4 + 1/2 = 3A ⇒ 9/2 = 3A ⇒ A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^2 -1)/2 = (9-1)/2=8/2=4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=27-1=26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that works.

Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until there are 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's count the number of ""1 +"" sections. Each ""1 +"" is part of a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>So, actually, the outermost expression is 3(Layer 9). So the total number of layers is 9, each adding another 3 multiplied by a term. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, I need to compute each layer starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so each Layer n is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me tabulate this: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so Layer 9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3:  <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the initial answer was 88572, which matches. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my layers because I might have miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each time, it's 1 + 3(...). So how many times does this happen? Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" sections. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each ""1 +"" has a 3(...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), then each time, another (1 + 3(...)). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" in the expression. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>- After the first 3, there's a (1 + 3(...)), which is one layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent ""1 +"" is another layer. Let me count: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost to the outermost, the expression is built as: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 1 + 3(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed earlier, Layer 9 was 29524, leading to 3*29524=88572. So that's correct. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each layer again, just to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed Layer 7, I have 3*1093=3279, which is correct. Then Layer 7 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*3280=9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*9841=29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as L(n) = 1 + 3*L(n-1), with L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is L(n) = 3*L(n-1) + 1, with L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, homogeneous equation: L(n) - 3L(n-1) = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r=3. So homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say L_p. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: L_p = 3*L_p + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for L_p: L_p - 3L_p = 1 => -2L_p =1 => L_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is L(n) = C*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now apply initial condition L(1)=4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is L(n) = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, L(n) = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer n is (3^(n+1) -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is (3^(10) -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, Layer 9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute it directly step by step without using the formula. <nEwLiNe>But since I already did the step-by-step computation and verified with the formula, I'm confident the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I started by recognizing the pattern, computed each layer step by step, then double-checked using a recurrence relation formula, which gave the same result. So I'm pretty sure the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous layer)}\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. The final answer is: <nEwLiNe>**88572** <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. <nEwLiNe>### Step-by-Step Computation: <nEwLiNe>1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. **Layer 2:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 1} = 1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. **Layer 3:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 2} = 1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. **Layer 4:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 3} = 1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>5. **Layer 5:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 4} = 1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>6. **Layer 6:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 5} = 1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>7. **Layer 7:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 6} = 1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>8. **Layer 8:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 7} = 1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>9. **Layer 9:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times \text{Layer 8} = 1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>10. **Final Step:** <nEwLiNe>    \[ <nEwLiNe>    3 \times \text{Layer 9} = 3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>    \] <nEwLiNe>### Final Answer: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 But I need to show the steps to reach that. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way out.  <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each layer wraps around that with another 1 + 3(...), multiplied by 3 each time.  <nEwLiNe>Let me label each layer from the inside out as layers 1 to 9.

So, I think I missed that last step. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing the innermost parentheses up to layer 9, which gives 29524, the entire expression is 3 times that.  <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>Nothing left, so write down 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me do it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*       3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 → 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 → 7, carryover 0 <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15 → 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 → 7, carryover 0 <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 → 7, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>There's no digit left, so bring down the carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the answer. So, the steps are: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>I think that's all. Each layer depends on the previous one, so working from the inside out is the way to go. It's like peeling an onion, layer by layer. Each time, I'm calculating the value inside the parentheses and then using it in the next outer layer. Finally, after getting the value of the entire parentheses expression, I multiply by 3 to get the final result.  <nEwLiNe>I can double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. Let me verify a few steps: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>- Final multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>All the intermediate steps check out. So, the final answer is indeed 88572.  <nEwLiNe>I guess another way to think about this is recognizing the pattern. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive multiplication where each term is thrice the previous plus one. It's similar to a geometric series but with an added 1 each time. However, since each term is multiplied by 3 and then added 1, it's a bit different.  <nEwLiNe>If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, it's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>C = 3C + 1 <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2C = 1 <nEwLiNe>C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Perfect, the formula works. So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Since there are 9 layers, starting from n=1 to n=9, the outermost parentheses value is a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. That's the same as I got earlier.  <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. So, this method also confirms the answer. <nEwLiNe>It's interesting to see that recognizing the pattern allows us to find a closed-form solution, avoiding the need to compute each layer step by step. But since the problem is only 9 layers deep, the step-by-step computation is manageable. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's another way to think about this. Maybe expanding the entire expression? Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. <nEwLiNe>So, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can represent E in terms of itself or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>But since it's a finite expression with 9 layers, it's not a typical recursive definition where E is defined in terms of itself. So, perhaps the step-by-step approach is the most straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe using a calculator or programming to compute each step, but since it's only 9 layers, doing it manually is feasible. <nEwLiNe>Wait, another idea: since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and we have 9 layers, starting from 4, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like 4, then 13, 40, 121, etc., as I computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps using exponents, since each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, which is the same recurrence as before. <nEwLiNe>So, using the closed-form formula, we can compute a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is to notice that the entire expression is 3 multiplied by a number that is 1 + 3*(another number), which is similar to base-3 expansions or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. <nEwLiNe>I think I've explored multiple ways to approach this problem: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, finding a closed-form formula, and verifying through different methods. All lead to the same answer, 88572.  <nEwLiNe>I feel confident that this is the correct answer because all the intermediate steps check out, and the closed-form solution using the recurrence relation also gives the same result. It's a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing patterns to simplify the computation. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, looking at the expression, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the inner layer). So, each time, I take the innermost expression, compute it, then plug it into the next one. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this out step by step, maybe numbering each layer from inside out. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems to add up. Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yep, all layers check out. So, the computation seems correct. Each time, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. It's like a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. Starting from 4, then 13, 40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's a formula for this kind of sequence. It seems similar to a geometric series, but with an added constant each time. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n as the value at each layer, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: 4 + 1/2 = 3*C => 9/2 = 3*C => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so n = 9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the outermost multiplication by 3 gives 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using both iterative computation and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same answer, which is reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could think of this expression as a base-3 number or something, but I don't think that's necessary here. The step-by-step approach worked fine. <nEwLiNe>Just to double-check, let me compute each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yep, all steps are consistent. I think I can confidently say the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I guess the key takeaway here is that even though the expression looks intimidating with all those parentheses, breaking it down layer by layer makes it manageable. It's a good reminder to not get overwhelmed by the presentation but focus on the structure. <nEwLiNe>Another thing is recognizing the recurrence relation. Once I saw that each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer), I could model it with a formula, which saved me from computing each layer manually, though in this case since there were only 9 layers, it wasn't too bad. <nEwLiNe>But it's a useful skill for more complex problems where computing each layer step by step would be impractical. <nEwLiNe>Also, verifying the result using two different methods—iterative computation and the closed-form formula—helps ensure that the answer is correct. It's a good practice to cross-validate, especially when dealing with repetitive computations where it's easy to make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's a pattern or if this relates to any known mathematical concepts. The expression seems to build up a number that's one less than a power of 3, scaled appropriately. Specifically, since 3^10 is 59049, and we have 59048/2 = 29524, which is just under 3^10. <nEwLiNe>It's interesting how these nested operations can lead to exponential growth, even though each step is linear in operations. The multiplication by 3 each time compounds the growth quickly. <nEwLiNe>If I were to generalize this, the expression 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with n layers would evaluate to (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 multiplied by 3, which would be (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. Wait, let me check that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's think again. <nEwLiNe>From the general formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n layers inside the first multiplication by 3, the total expression is 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, n = 9, so it's (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. Yep, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula for such an expression with k layers inside the first 3(...) would be (3^{k+2} - 3)/2. That's a neat formula to remember for similar problems. <nEwLiNe>But in this specific case, since the expression is given, it's straightforward to compute step by step or use the formula. Either way, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I've thought this through thoroughly. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I'm confident the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is calculated as \(1 + 3 \times \text{(result of the inner layer)}\). This process is repeated for each layer, and the final result is multiplied by 3.

 But I need to see the step-by-step explanation. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like each layer is a multiplication by 3 and then adding 1. Maybe I can break it down step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3(4) is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out, we have 1 + 3(13). Let's calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3(13) is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay, so each time, I take the result from the previous step, multiply it by 3, add 1, and then use that in the next layer. This seems to be a repeating pattern. Let me write this down step by step to keep track. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure I count the layers correctly. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each time, I'm moving outward, so I should have nine steps, right? Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's only nine steps, but the original expression has ten 3s? Or is it nine layers? Let me check the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, nine layers. Each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is the ninth layer, I have nine computations, each time moving outward. Then, the outermost operation is multiplying the result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in my initial count, step 1 was the innermost, which is the ninth layer. Then, step 2 is the eighth layer, and so on until step 9, which is the outermost layer, which is 1 + 3*(result). Then, the very outermost operation is multiplying that by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, perhaps I miscounted. Let me write out the structure: <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is 3*( ... ), where the ... is 1 + 3*( ... ), and so on, nine times. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first step. Then each subsequent step adds a layer, so step 1: innermost, step 2: next layer, ..., step 9: the outermost 1 + 3*(...), and then finally, multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, step 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that matches the answer given. So, yeah, step by step, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), starting from 4, and then multiplying the last result by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>_________ <nEwLiNe>Compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 *3=88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the final result is 88,572. That matches the given answer. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough. I broke it down step by step, verified each computation, and made sure that each layer was computed correctly. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but taking it one step at a time helps prevent errors. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication and addition problem.

 But how? <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see if I can break it down step by step. I remember that when dealing with nested expressions, you start from the innermost parentheses and work your way out. So, I'll start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time I replace the innermost parentheses, I can move one layer out. So, let me list each step with the corresponding number. <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression now is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Now, compute the next innermost parentheses, which is (1 + 3(4)). <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 1 + 3*4. First, do the multiplication: 3*4 = 12. Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Next innermost is (1 + 3(13)). <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39. Then add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Replacing that, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Next, compute (1 + 3(40)). <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120. Then 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Compute (1 + 3(121)). <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363. 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Expression now:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Compute (1 + 3(364)). <nEwLiNe>3*364: Let me calculate that. 300*3=900, 64*3=192, so total is 900 + 192 = 1092.

So 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523.

So adding those together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, 87000 + 1500 = 88500, 88500 + 75 = 88575. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The answer is supposed to be 88572, but I'm getting 88575. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check each step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the beginning: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093 again. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524. Wait, hold on! In step 10, I think I messed up. I thought the expression was 3(1 + 29524), which is 3*(29525). But actually, looking back, the expression after step 9 is 3(1 + 3(9841)) which becomes 3(1 + 29524). So step 10 is 3*(29525). So, yes, 3*29525 = 88575. But the answer is supposed to be 88572. So where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step 6 or somewhere else. Let me go back step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Step 6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Step 7: 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Step 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. 9000 + 840 = 9840. 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Step 9: 1 + 3*9841. 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 41*3=123. 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 123 is 29523. 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Step 10: 1 + 3*29524. Wait, no! Wait a second. Let me check the expression after step 9. <nEwLiNe>After step 9, the expression is 3(1 + 3(9841)). So that's 3*(1 + 3*9841) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>But 3*29524: Let's compute that again. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Oh! Wait, I see my mistake now. Earlier, I thought 3*29524 was 88575, but actually, 29524 * 3 is 88572. I must have added incorrectly before. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>= 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct.
