Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3(40). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 364. Next layer is 1 + 3(364). Let's compute. <nEwLiNe>3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me figure that out. <nEwLiNe>3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280. Well, 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 9841. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(9841). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent each time. So, I think 88573 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88573}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>5.

Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: <nEwLiNe>    \[ <nEwLiNe>    1 + 3 \times 29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>    \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88573}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 364. Next layer is 1 + 3(364). Let's compute. <nEwLiNe>3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me figure that out. <nEwLiNe>3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280. Well, 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 9841. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(9841). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3(40). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 364. Next layer is 1 + 3(364). Let's compute. <nEwLiNe>3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me figure that out. <nEwLiNe>3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573.

Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280. Well, 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 9841. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(9841). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523.

Let's break it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573.

Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 3 times 4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(13). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3(40). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120. Then, 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that's 121. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(121). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 121 is 363. Then, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 364. Next layer is 1 + 3(364). Let's compute. <nEwLiNe>3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me figure that out. <nEwLiNe>3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279.

Let's break it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573.

Let's compute. <nEwLiNe>3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so 1080 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let me figure that out. <nEwLiNe>3 times 1093. Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 3280. Next layer is 1 + 3(3280). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 3280. Well, 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 9841. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(9841). Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 9841. Hmm, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 29524. Now, moving out to the outermost layer, we have 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 29524. Let's break it down: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88573. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent each time.
