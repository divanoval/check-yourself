Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) 
Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each layer is another set of 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write it down as I go.
Starting from the inside:
The innermost part is 1 + 3.

 1 + 3 is 4.  <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3(4) is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, it's: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(13). Let's compute 3*13 first. <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Replacing that, now we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))  <nEwLiNe>Moving one layer out: 1 + 3(40).  <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. <nEwLiNe>So, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(121).  <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Now, replacing that: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(364).  <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(1093).  <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280).  <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841))  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(9841).  <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(29524)  <nEwLiNe>Now, just compute that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, let me do that multiplication step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 88572. Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me just double-check all my steps to make sure I didn't skip anything or make a calculation error. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*40=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*121=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then 3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yep, that all adds up correctly.

 So, 1 + 3 is 4. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*(that result). Let me compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers for clarity.

 1 + 3 is 4. So, let's replace that: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, right?

So starting from the innermost, which is the 9th layer? Wait, perhaps not. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) expressions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems like 9 layers inside the outermost 3.

Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's see, 3000*3 is 9000, 280*3 is 840. So 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*9841. Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Moving outward again: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 3*29524. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 3*88573. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. <nEwLiNe>So now, we have the entire expression simplified to 265720. But wait, the original expression is 3 multiplied by all that. So we have to compute 3*265720. Let me do that: 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. Adding them together: 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. So, 3*265720 is 797160. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 797160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to miscalculate with such large numbers. Let's go back through each step quickly: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct. <nEwLiNe>11. Next: 1 + 3*88573 = 1 + 265719 = 265720. Correct. <nEwLiNe>12. Finally, 3*265720 = 797160. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step checks out. Therefore, I'm confident that the final result is 797,160. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression simplifies step by step starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is computed by multiplying 3 with the result of the inner expression and adding 1. After working through each layer, the final result is 797,160. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{797160}$"

 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that part is straightforward. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that.  <nEwLiNe>So, 3 times 4 is 12, right? Then 1 + 12 is 13. Got it. So the next layer becomes 1 + 3(13). Let me calculate that.  <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then 1 + 39 is 40. Hmm, so that layer simplifies to 40. Moving outward, the next one is 1 + 3(40).  <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3 times 40 is 120. Then 1 + 120 is 121. Alright, so now that layer is 121.  <nEwLiNe>Going one step further, the next layer is 1 + 3(121). Let me compute 3 times 121 first. 121 times 3 is 363. Then adding 1 gives 364. So, that layer simplifies to 364.  <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next part is 1 + 3(364). Hmm, 3 times 364 is... let me see, 360 times 3 is 1080, and 4 times 3 is 12, so total is 1092. Then adding 1 gives 1093. So that layer is 1093.  <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(1093). Let's compute 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding those together: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then adding 1 gives 3280. So that layer is 3280.  <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). Let's compute 3 times 3280. 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So adding them up: 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then adding 1 gives 9841. So that layer simplifies to 9841.  <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, we have 1 + 3(9841). Calculating 3 times 9841. Let's break it down: 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding them all together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then adding 1 gives 29524. So that layer is 29524.  <nEwLiNe>Moving to the next layer: 1 + 3(29524). Let me compute 3 times 29524. 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding them all: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then adding 1 gives 88573. So that layer is 88573.  <nEwLiNe>Next, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by that result. So 3 times 88573. Let me calculate that. 80000 times 3 is 240000, 8000 times 3 is 24000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 70 times 3 is 210, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding all together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that multiplication because it's a big number. 88573 times 3.  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>3 x 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3 x 7 = 21, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 x 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 x 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 x 8 = 24 + 2 = 26.  <nEwLiNe>So writing it down: 265719. Yeah, that seems right.  <nEwLiNe>So putting it all together, starting from the innermost parentheses and working out, each step builds up to the next. So the final result is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{265719}. <nEwLiNe>"

So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier when I thought I had 11 layers, I got 797,160, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>So, to confirm, the expression has 9 layers of ""1 + 3(...)"", and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can notice a pattern here. Each layer is following a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for a linear recurrence like a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + C, where C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>To find C, set a_n = C = 3*C + 1 => C = 1/2. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>If a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, then the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, and a particular solution can be found by assuming a constant solution C. <nEwLiNe>So, C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3; 3^2=9; 3^3=27; 3^4=81; 3^5=243; 3^6=729; 3^7=2187; 3^8=6561; 3^9=19683; 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 *3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression simplifies step-by-step by evaluating each nested parentheses from the innermost layer outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \) with \( a_1 = 4 \). After computing up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3. Using the recurrence relation and solving the linear recurrence, the final value is found to be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"

 1 + 3 is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the next layer is 1 + 3(4).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer is 1 + 3(13). <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3(40). <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(364). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, 1 + 3(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(9841). 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>After that, 1 + 3(29524). 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 3(88573). So, 3*88573 is 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>11. Finally: 3*88573 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent each time. Each step, I multiplied by 3 and added 1. It looks like each layer follows the pattern of 1 + 3*(previous result). So starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3 times the previous number. That makes sense because each time you're going one layer out, you're doing the same operation. <nEwLiNe>Let me think if there's a formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like a geometric series or something. Let me try to model it. <nEwLiNe>If I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3, there are 9 sets of parentheses. So, actually, there are 9 layers, meaning a_1 to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, earlier I had 88573 as the last inner computation, but according to this, a_9 should be 29524. Hmm, maybe I messed up the count. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): Starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer wraps another 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and inside each 1 + 3, there's another 1 + 3(...), and so on. Let's count the number of 1 + 3s: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 (innermost) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). So starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, a_4 = 121, a_5 = 364, a_6 = 1093, a_7 = 3280, a_8 = 9841, a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I ended up with 265719, but now according to this, it should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I must have miscounted the layers when I was computing step by step. Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I went up to 88573 and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that must be incorrect because the expression is only 9 layers deep, so the final result should be 3*(Layer 9). So, my initial step-by-step had an extra layer. Let me see why. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. Let me count the number of 1 + 3s: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>Yes, so 9 layers. So, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer 9). So, the result is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I thought the outermost was 3*(88573) which was incorrect. So, I think I miscounted the layers earlier. So, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I can think of it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>Let's find A and B. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I think my initial step-by-step had an error because I miscounted the layers, thinking there were more layers than there actually were. So, correcting that, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see the pattern in the a_n sequence. <nEwLiNe>Each a_n is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9 = 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm 3^{10} is indeed 59049. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3*a_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute step by step again: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I confused myself earlier by thinking there were more layers, but actually, it's 9 layers, so the final computation is 3*a_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 So, 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3(4) = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3(13). Let's calculate: <nEwLiNe>3(13) = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3(40). Hmm, 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3(121). 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 3(364). 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: 1 + 3(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 3(9841). 3*9841 is 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3(29524). 3*29524 is 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result.

 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, compute the multiplication: 3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out is 1 + 3(13). Let me do that: <nEwLiNe>3 * 13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each time I go out a layer, I'm taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1? Let me check that. <nEwLiNe>So, if I denote each layer as a step, starting from the innermost, which is step 1: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2: 1 + 3*(Step 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Step 3: 1 + 3*(Step 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Step 4: 1 + 3*(Step 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure. So each time, I'm multiplying the previous step by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like a recursive sequence where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, starting from 4. <nEwLiNe>So, step 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>step 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>step 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>step 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>step 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>step 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>step 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>step 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>step 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>step 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire thing, right?

So, let's see, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking back: the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, that means the total number of steps is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I started, I thought step 1 was 1 + 3, which is 4. Then step 2 is 1 + 3*4, which is 13. So, each step corresponds to one layer. So, if there are 9 layers, then step 9 is the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).

The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s: Each time it's 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, so starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers. So I think I did 9 layers correctly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me recount each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), so after computing the innermost 1 + 3(...), which is 29524, we have 3*(29524). So actually, the outermost operation is 3*29524, not 1 + 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me look again at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So the entire expression is 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and the outermost layer is 3*(result of the inner layers). <nEwLiNe>So I think I made a mistake in my initial steps because I included an extra 1 + at the end. Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by 29524, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check because I think I might have messed up the number of layers. Let me count the number of times we have ""1 + 3(...)"". <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 has another layer. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers because the expression ends with 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, when I count the number of opening parentheses after each 3, I think it's 9 layers inside. So my initial computation was correct, ending up with 29524 before multiplying by the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>So 3*29524 is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify with a different approach. Maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. <nEwLiNe>This looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>So the expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So I can compute a_1 through a_9 step by step: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So that's consistent with my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, equating both sides: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3*B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So for a9, n=9: <nEwLiNe>a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation. Therefore, the total expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, thinking about it, each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So it's similar to a geometric series where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. But in this case, since it's nested, it's more like a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 So, 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from the innermost). Wait, no, actually, looking at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(something). So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There's one after each 3, so starting from the first 3(1 + ...), how many times does this happen? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and each time, the next layer is another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) parts. Starting from the first 3, then each 3 inside is another layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), so starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, maybe it's like a geometric series or something. Let me try to compute it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Let's say a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression starts with 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing a9, which is 29524, the outermost expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>So, the total would be 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check the number of layers. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...). Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), and each subsequent 3 is followed by another (1 + 3(...)). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the first 3, how many layers? Let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) - outermost <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) - next <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>It's a bit confusing, but perhaps I can think of it as starting from the innermost and working out.

The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is layer 1: a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*a(n). So, the number of layers is 9, because after the innermost, there are 8 more layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...).

So, the innermost is the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Starting from the first 3, we have (1 + 3(...)), which is 8 more layers, because each subsequent 3 has another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous).

Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought a10 was 88573, but that was when I miscounted the layers. So, actually, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(a9), where a9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Compute a1 to a9: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, total = 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series.

 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, let me check. Each layer is 1 + 3*(something).

 1 + 3 is 4. So, that part simplifies to 4.  <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that 4. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 3*4 is 12, and 1 + 12 is 13. So, that layer simplifies to 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out is 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that. 3*13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So, this layer is 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, that's 121. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. So, that's 364. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(364). 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So, 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So, 3280. <nEwLiNe>Another layer: 1 + 3*(3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So, 9841. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward: 1 + 3*(9841). 3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So, 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me recount how many layers there are. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (...)), and each time I simplified one layer, I moved one step out. Let me check how many times I did that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(4) = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, then 1 + 3*40 = 121, then 1 + 3*121 = 364, 1 + 3*364 = 1093, 1 + 3*1093 = 3280, 1 + 3*3280 = 9841, 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Hmm, so that's 9 layers? Wait, no. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))). So, counting the number of 1 + 3(...): starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is used. The expression is 3*(...), and inside that, 1 + 3*(...), which continues 8 more times? Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to count the number of ""1 + 3(...)"" expressions. Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so there are 10 layers? Let me check the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...).

Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, 1 + 3 is 1 layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...).

Then each time, we go one layer out, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then the outermost 3*(...). So total layers after the initial 3* are 9, each adding another 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the expression, how many 1 + 3(...) are there? Let me count. <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(...).

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then inside is (1 + 3(...)). Each time, inside another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of times we have (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, the first (1 + 3(...) is one, then each subsequent (1 + 3(...) is another.

Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the first ( is the start of the first (1 + 3(...)).

So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier calculation, I went up to 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), then the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then layer 1: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, but actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, but each layer is another (1 + 3*(...)). So, if there are 9 layers, I need to compute 9 times. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result).

Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each layer out, 9 layers, ending up with 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the expression is 3*(layer9). So, the total is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm the number of layers. The expression is 3 followed by 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer1, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...), so layer2, layer3, up to layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8). So, layer9 is 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting with layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, outermost: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a pattern or a formula that can be used here? It seems like each layer is following a geometric progression. <nEwLiNe>Let me think: Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recursive formula is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants to be determined. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, using the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the earlier results. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (3^5 -1)/2 =243 -1=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=729 -1=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (3^7 -1)/2=2187 -1=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (3^8 -1)/2=6561 -1=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (3^9 -1)/2=19683 -1=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, the formula works. So, a_9 =29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, could we have used the formula from the start? <nEwLiNe>Yes, since a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=59049 -1=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods confirm that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the recursive approach as well as the closed-form formula both lead to the same result. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication that can be simplified step by step.

 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the next layer is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure. Is it 3 multiplied by the next parentheses? Yeah, looking at the structure, each time it's 3 times (1 + something). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from the inside out as Layer 1 to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that because I might have miscounted the layers. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So actually, the innermost is Layer 1, and then each subsequent layer is another multiplication by 3 and adding 1. So my earlier breakdown is correct, starting from Layer 1 to Layer 9. So the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me clarify. The entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So Layer 9 is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, let me make sure.

The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So yes, the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(previous), so Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3. So 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So 29,524 * 3 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that seems high. Let me check the multiplication step by step. <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So the result is 88,572.

Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct, 9 layers. So the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, I have a doubt. When I look at the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 more layers? Or is it 9 layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(1 + 3(...)), so the innermost is 1 + 3, then each step adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, there are 8 more 3*(1 + ...) terms? Or 9? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse it: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3*(...). The innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3*(...). So from Layer 1 to Layer 9, each corresponding to each set of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So total layers are 9, so Layer 9 is 29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's 8 layers because the first 3 is outside. Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with how many inner expressions? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. So starting from the innermost, each step is a layer. The innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer9: 1 + 3*(Layer8). So yes, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me recast the computation step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>------------ <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So writing it together: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to verify, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048 <nEwLiNe>59,048 + 29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that works too. <nEwLiNe>So the total is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute Layer9 again: <nEwLiNe>Layer8 is 9841. So 3*9841 is 29,523. Then 29,523 +1 = 29,524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then 3*29,524 = 88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression simplifies step by step from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3 times the previous result. After computing all nine layers, the innermost result is 29,524. Multiplying this by 3 gives the final result of 88,572. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"
17,88572,1,12,6271,"
 So, 1 + 3 is 4.  <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*(13). Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*40. Let me compute 3*40 first, which is 120, so 1 + 120 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating 3*1093: 1093*3 is 3279, so 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 3*3280. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Moving outward: 1 + 3*29524. Let's calculate 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding these up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let me compute 3*88573. 88573*3: 80000*3=240000, 8000*3=24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. Adding them up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. So, 1 + 265719 is 265720. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(265720). Let me compute that: 265720*3. 200000*3=600000, 60000*3=180000, 5000*3=15000, 700*3=2100, 20*3=60. Adding these together: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that multiplication step by step: <nEwLiNe>265,720 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>0*3=0 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 <nEwLiNe>7*3=21 (carryover 2) <nEwLiNe>5*3=15 + 2 = 17 (carryover 1) <nEwLiNe>6*3=18 + 1 = 19 (carryover 1) <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 + 1 = 7 <nEwLiNe>So writing it down: <nEwLiNe>265,720 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>= 797,160 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies step by step to 797,160. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me recount the layers to make sure I didn't miss any. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), and each layer is another multiplication. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of (1 + 3(...)), so starting from the innermost, I worked out nine layers, right? Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's only nine layers, but the expression has eight layers inside the first 3. Wait, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of (1 + 3(...)): starting from the innermost, it's 1+3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after each 1 + 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to how many? Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the outside: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Inside the first parentheses: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have another 1 + 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3 is nested. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Continuing, each time adding another layer. So, how many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(previous result) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many times do we do this? Let's count the number of ""1 + 3("" segments. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the first layer after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps it's 8 layers inside the first 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>   - The first ""1 + 3("" is the second character, then each subsequent ""("" adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps it's better to count the number of closing parentheses. Alternatively, I can note that the innermost expression is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I can model this as a recursive expression or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had 3*(265720) which was 797,160, but now according to this, a_9 is 29524, so 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a discrepancy. So, I think I messed up the number of layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let's clarify: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers of 1 + 3 are there? Let's count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the outside: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(...))  <nEwLiNe>Inside that: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have another ""1 + 3(...)"". Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the first layer is 3*(...), then inside it, 1 + 3*(...), and this continues until the innermost 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>How many layers? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The first layer is 3*(...), which contains the second layer: 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>- The second layer is 1 + 3*(...), which contains the third layer: 1 + 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>- This continues until the ninth layer, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, which is layer 1, then each time we go outward, it's another layer. So, layer 1: 1 + 3, layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1), layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2), ..., up to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). Then the outermost is 3*(layer9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that would mean that a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 797,160. That suggests that perhaps I miscalculated the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's recount. If the innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Then each time, moving outward, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had more layers because I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me look at the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer.

Then, inside that, we have 1 + 3*(...). That's the second layer. Each subsequent ""1 + 3("" is another layer. <nEwLiNe>Let's parse the string: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as: <nEwLiNe>3( layer9 ) <nEwLiNe>Where layer9 = 1 + 3( layer8 ) <nEwLiNe>layer8 = 1 + 3( layer7 ) <nEwLiNe>layer7 = 1 + 3( layer6 ) <nEwLiNe>layer6 = 1 + 3( layer5 ) <nEwLiNe>layer5 = 1 + 3( layer4 ) <nEwLiNe>layer4 = 1 + 3( layer3 ) <nEwLiNe>layer3 = 1 + 3( layer2 ) <nEwLiNe>layer2 = 1 + 3( layer1 ) <nEwLiNe>layer1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, layer1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>layer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>layer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>layer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>layer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>layer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>layer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>layer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers, computing up to 265,720 and then multiplying by 3 to get 797,160. So, that suggests that I had one extra layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: each ""1 + 3("" introduces a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer.

And so on, until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, from the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer, so starting from the first, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, in total, there are 8 layers after the initial 3. Therefore, the layers are from layer2 to layer9, which is 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that conflicts with my earlier counting where layer1 was 1 + 3. Maybe my initial indexing was off. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again: <nEwLiNe>Define: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost expression is layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>- Then layer2: 1 + 3*layer1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>- layer3: 1 + 3*layer2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>- layer4: 1 + 3*layer3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>- layer5: 1 + 3*layer4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>- layer6: 1 + 3*layer5 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>- layer7: 1 + 3*layer6 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>- layer8: 1 + 3*layer7 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>- layer9: 1 + 3*layer8 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But according to the expression, the outermost is 3*(...), which is 3*layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I computed up to 265,720, I must have added an extra layer, which wasn't present in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let's verify this with a smaller example to see if the method is correct. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if we count the layers: <nEwLiNe>layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>layer2: 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>layer3: 1 + 3*13 =40 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression: 3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, if we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)), compute: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 =4 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression: 3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Which is correct. <nEwLiNe>So, in the original problem, the number of layers is 9, starting from 1 + 3 up to the outermost 3*(...). Wait, but in the small example, 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) has two layers inside the 3*, which is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13=39. <nEwLiNe>So, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with eight layers inside. Wait, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers inside is equal to the number of ""1 + 3("" segments. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous term. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote a_n as the value of the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 =13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 =1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 =1 + 3*a_3=1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>a_5=1 + 3*a_4=1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>a_6=1 + 3*a_5=1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7=1 + 3*a_6=1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8=1 + 3*a_7=1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9=1 + 3*a_8=1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>So, with 9 layers, a_9=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I computed up to 265,720, I was mistakenly considering 10 layers instead of 9, which led to an incorrect result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let's compute it step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 =4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next:1 + 3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next:1 + 3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1 + 3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:1 + 3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1 + 3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:1 + 3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1 + 3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally:3*29524=88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's 10 steps, but the layers are 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, step1:1+3=4 (layer1) <nEwLiNe>step2:1 + 3*4=13 (layer2) <nEwLiNe>step3:1 + 3*13=40 (layer3) <nEwLiNe>step4:1 + 3*40=121 (layer4) <nEwLiNe>step5:1 + 3*121=364 (layer5) <nEwLiNe>step6:1 + 3*364=1093 (layer6) <nEwLiNe>step7:1 + 3*1093=3280 (layer7) <nEwLiNe>step8:1 + 3*3280=9841 (layer8) <nEwLiNe>step9:1 + 3*9841=29524 (layer9) <nEwLiNe>step10:3*29524=88572 (outermost multiplication) <nEwLiNe>So, in total, 10 steps, but the layers inside are 9, with the outermost multiplication being the 10th step. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3 to get the final answer. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{88572}$"

 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3(4) = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3(13). <nEwLiNe>3(13) = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(40). <nEwLiNe>3(40) = 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: 1 + 3(121). <nEwLiNe>3(121) = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3(364). <nEwLiNe>3(364) = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Another layer: 1 + 3(1093). <nEwLiNe>3(1093) = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3(3280). <nEwLiNe>3(3280) = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 3(9841). <nEwLiNe>3(9841) = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 1 + 3(29524). <nEwLiNe>3(29524) = 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Now, multiply this by 3: <nEwLiNe>3 * 88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>11. 3*88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent each time. Maybe I can recognize a pattern here. Each step is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 1. Let me denote each step as a term in a sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a₂ = 1 + 3a₁. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a₃ = 1 + 3a₂, and so on, up to a₉. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, we're computing a₉, where each aₙ = 1 + 3aₙ₋₁, starting from a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for aₙ. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is aₙ = 3aₙ₋₁ + 1, with a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by solving the homogeneous equation and finding a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is aₙ - 3aₙ₋₁ = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is aₙ = A*3ⁿ - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n = 1: 4 = A*3¹ - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form solution is aₙ = (3/2)*3ⁿ - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Since we have 9 layers, starting from a₁ up to a₉, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = (3² - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>a₂ = (3³ - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which matches. <nEwLiNe>a₃ = (3⁴ - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, which also matches. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: <nEwLiNe>3¹ = 3 <nEwLiNe>3² = 9 <nEwLiNe>3³ = 27 <nEwLiNe>3⁴ = 81 <nEwLiNe>3⁵ = 243 <nEwLiNe>3⁶ = 729 <nEwLiNe>3⁷ = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3⁸ = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3⁹ = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3¹⁰ = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got up to 88573 before multiplying by 3. Hmm, perhaps I have a misunderstanding here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, after computing the innermost parentheses up to a₉ = 29524, the expression becomes 3*(1 + 3*a₉) = 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But according to the sequence I defined, a₉ = 29524, which is the value before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, in the sequence, each aₙ corresponds to the innermost expression after n layers. So, the total expression is 3*(a₉), but wait, no: <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the first a₁ is the innermost 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, a₂ is the next layer: 1 + 3*a₁, which is 13, and so on, up to a₉, which is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(a₉). But wait, no, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the total expression is 3*(a₉). <nEwLiNe>But according to the sequence, a₉ is already 29524, which is 1 + 3*a₈. So, the outermost expression is 3*(a₉) = 3*29524 = 88572. But wait, in my step-by-step computation earlier, I had 3*(1 + 3*a₉) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265,719. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my indexing is off. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>If I have 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)), then starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers because I went up to 1 + 3*29524, which would be Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression has how many layers? Let's count the number of 3s: each (1 + 3(...)) is a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which is Layer 1, then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the 9th layer: 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I computed up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. That suggests I counted 10 layers instead of 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's recount the number of (1 + 3(...)) layers. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(that) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 1, then each subsequent is another layer, and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, total layers inside the multiplication by 3 is 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I computed step by step, I went up to Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. But that would be if there were 10 layers inside the multiplication by 3. So, perhaps the confusion is whether the multiplication by 3 is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the multiplication by 3 is outside all the parentheses. So, the number of (1 + 3(...)) layers is 9, each nested inside the previous. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then 1 + 3*(1 + 3), and so on, 9 times, and then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct computation is to compute the 9th layer as 29524, then multiply by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, perhaps I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, then each subsequent ( is another layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>11. ))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3(, meaning 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). Therefore, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, and the outermost is Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my step-by-step, I had 10 layers, which included the initial 3*(Layer 9). So, perhaps I was miscounting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, the total number of layers inside the 3* is 9. Therefore, the computation should be: <nEwLiNe>Compute Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, which would be Layer 10, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. So, that suggests that I considered the initial 3* as part of the layers, which it's not. The initial 3* is outside all the parentheses, so the layers inside are only 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct total is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I thought the expression was 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which would mean that the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8, and then multiply by 3: 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>So, that would be 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>However, when I computed step by step earlier, I had: <nEwLiNe>After Layer9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>But that would imply that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*Layer9), which would be 10 layers inside the initial 3*. But according to the original expression, it's only 9 layers inside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I added an extra layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the number of (1 + 3(...)) in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, adding another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many (1 + 3(...)) are there? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3(: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3( is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of layers inside the 3* is 9. So, the innermost is Layer1: 1 + 3, Layer2: 1 + 3*Layer1, up to Layer9: 1 + 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>Thus, Layer9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went up to Layer10: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3, leading to 265,719. That suggests that I considered an extra layer, which isn't present in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I miscounted the number of layers. The correct computation should stop at Layer9, which is 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let's verify with the closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>We had aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Since there are 9 layers, n = 9. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer should be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I had 265,719, which is 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*88573. But according to the expression, it's only 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, why the discrepancy? Because in the original expression, it's 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + 3*Layer9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer1: 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to Layer10: 1 + 3*Layer9 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719. That would be if the expression was 3*(1 + 3*Layer9), which would imply 10 layers inside the 3*, which is not the case. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I must have miscounted the layers. The correct number of layers inside the 3* is 9, leading to 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)) explicitly. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) inside the initial 3*. Therefore, the innermost is Layer1: 4, Layer2:13,... up to Layer9:29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I added an extra layer, considering the 3* as part of the layers, which it isn't. The 3* is outside all the parentheses, so only 9 layers are inside. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, to make sure, let's compute it step by step correctly. <nEwLiNe>Compute Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the closed-form formula: <nEwLiNe>a₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a₉ = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I got 265,719, which is 3*(1 + 3*29524) = 3*88573 = 265,719. But that would be if the expression had one more layer inside the 3*, which it doesn't. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the confusion was in the number of layers. The correct number of layers inside the 3* is 9, leading to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the expression is interpreted differently. Let's parse the expression carefully. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost is 3*(Layer9). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct computation is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let's compute it step by step again, carefully: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the initial step-by-step was incorrect because I mistakenly added an extra layer, considering the multiplication by 3 as part of the layers, which it isn't. The correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by simplifying from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is of the form \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous layer)}\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the result is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply by 3: \(3 \times 29524 = 88572\). <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I've got this math problem here that looks a bit complicated with all these nested parentheses. It’s 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3)))))))))). Wow, that's a mouthful! But I think I can break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I need to understand the structure of this expression. It seems like it's a series of nested operations where each layer is of the form ""1 plus 3 times something."" So, starting from the innermost part, I can simplify each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to visualize this. If I start from the inside, the innermost part is ""1 plus 3."" That seems straightforward. Then, moving one layer out, it's ""1 plus 3 times the result of the innermost part."" I can keep doing this until I reach the outermost layer, which is all multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Maybe I can write this down step by step to make it clearer. Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 1 + 3 * Layer 1 <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 1 + 3 * Layer 2 <nEwLiNe>- ... <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: 1 + 3 * Layer 8 <nEwLiNe>And finally, the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>**Layer 1:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 2:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 1 = 1 + 3 * 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 3:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 4:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 3 = 1 + 3 * 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 5:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 4 = 1 + 3 * 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 6:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 5 = 1 + 3 * 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 7:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 6 = 1 + 3 * 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 8:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 7 = 1 + 3 * 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>**Layer 9:**   <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 * Layer 8 = 1 + 3 * 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each layer step by step, I find that the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think I did this correctly, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3 * 4 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3 * 13 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3 * 40 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3 * 121 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3 * 364 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3 * 1093 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3 * 3280 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3 * 9841 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>And finally: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Everything checks out. So, the final answer is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that could have made this computation easier instead of calculating each layer step by step. Maybe something related to geometric sequences or recursive relations? <nEwLiNe>Thinking about it, each layer is defined by the previous one: Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1). This looks like a recursive sequence where each term depends on the previous term. If I can find a closed-form expression for Layer n, it might save time for larger values of n. <nEwLiNe>Let's try to derive a general formula for Layer n. <nEwLiNe>Given: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * Layer 1 = 1 + 3 * 4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 = 1 + 3 * Layer 2 = 1 + 3 * 13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>In general: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 1 + 3 * Layer (n-1) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can find the homogeneous and particular solutions. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n - 3 * Layer (n-1) = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n (homogeneous) = A * 3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3C + 1 <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2C = 1 <nEwLiNe>C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = A * 3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition Layer 1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A * 3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = (3/2) * 3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let's verify this formula with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 = (3^(1+1) - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2 = (3^(2+1) - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 = (3^(3+1) - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>It works for the first few layers, so I'm confident the formula is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 = (3^(9+1) - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3 * Layer 9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, not only did I compute the expression step by step, but I also derived a general formula to find the value of any layer directly, which is pretty cool. <nEwLiNe>In summary, by breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable layers and recognizing the pattern in the recurrence relation, I was able to compute the value of the complex expression efficiently. <nEwLiNe>I think I've got a good handle on this now. The key takeaway is that when faced with nested expressions like this, looking for patterns and trying to find a general formula can save a lot of time, especially if the expression is long or if you need to compute similar expressions repeatedly. <nEwLiNe>Another thing I noticed is the exponential growth of the values as we move outward through the layers. Each layer's value is significantly larger than the previous one because of the multiplication by 3. This exponential growth is a characteristic of geometric sequences, which makes sense given the recursive nature of this problem. <nEwLiNe>It's also interesting to see how the closed-form formula simplifies the computation. Instead of calculating each layer step by step, which can be error-prone and time-consuming, especially for a large number of layers, the formula allows for direct computation. <nEwLiNe>I wonder how this would apply if there were more layers or if the multiplier were a different number. It might be a useful approach in other similar problems. <nEwLiNe>Overall, this exercise taught me the importance of recognizing patterns in mathematical expressions and the value of deriving general formulas to simplify computations. It also reinforced the concept of exponential growth in sequences, which is a fundamental idea in many areas of mathematics and science. <nEwLiNe>One thing I might want to explore further is how this kind of nested expression relates to other mathematical concepts, such as continued fractions or recursive functions. Understanding these connections could deepen my appreciation for the beauty and utility of mathematics. <nEwLiNe>In any case, I feel more confident now in tackling complex expressions with nested operations by breaking them down step by step and looking for underlying patterns or formulas that can make the process more efficient. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 1 + 3 is 4.  <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the next layer is 3(1 + 3(4)).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I parse it correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3 multiplied by another expression. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out one layer, we have 1 + 3*(previous result). So let me write each step down. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*4) <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting the number of 1 + 3(...) parts: starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of layers. Each time, we have an additional layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 4, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after computing Layer 9 as 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check. Let me parse the expression again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next, 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, that's nine layers, each time 1 + 3*(previous). So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: 29524*3. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Compute each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a nested expression? It seems like a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation can be solved. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10})/2 - 1/2 = (59049)/2 - 1/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 1 + 3 is 4. So that part becomes 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So 1 + 3*13. Let's calculate: <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*40. Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*121. Let's do the multiplication first: <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, then adding 1 gives 364. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, we have 1 + 3*364. So: <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Calculating: <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is 3279, then 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer is 1 + 3*9841. Let's figure this out: <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next, moving out another layer: 1 + 3*29524. Calculating: <nEwLiNe>3*29524 is 88572, plus 1 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute this: <nEwLiNe>3*88573 is 265719, plus 1 is 265720. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So: <nEwLiNe>3*265720. Let me calculate that: <nEwLiNe>265720 * 3 is 797160. <nEwLiNe>So, after simplifying each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, the final result is 797,160. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting again, perhaps I can recognize a pattern here. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me see if this is a geometric series or something. <nEwLiNe>If I let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13, <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40, <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121, <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364, <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093, <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280, <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524, <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 88572 = 88573, <nEwLiNe>and then the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Earlier, I thought the final result was 797,160, but now I'm getting 265,719. Which one is correct? Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think I messed up the number of layers. Let me count how many times 1 + 3 is nested. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis is another layer. Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of '3(' before the first 1 + 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is another layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>10. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so starting from the outermost 3, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). But in my earlier calculation, I had 10 layers because I started counting from a_1 as 1 + 3. Maybe that's where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... 9 times ... )). So perhaps the innermost is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3 times the previous. <nEwLiNe>So let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2, <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8. <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So let's compute a_1 to a_9 step by step: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I get 88,572. Hmm, this is conflicting with my previous calculations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the number of layers. Let me look again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>And so on, each time adding another 1 + 3(...). So how many times does this happen? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each layer adds one more 1 + 3. So let's count the number of closing parentheses after each 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3), then each next layer is 1 + 3(...)), so how many sets of )) are there? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of '1 + 3(' in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, how many times does this happen? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(...)) with 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the outermost 3, each subsequent layer is another 1 + 3(...). So the number of layers is 9 because there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)) inside each other. <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so earlier I thought the expression had 10 layers, but actually, it's 9 layers inside the outermost 3. So 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) starting from the innermost, leading to a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I did the first calculation, I had 10 layers, which gave me 797,160, which is incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, when I did the second calculation, I considered a_1 to a_9, which gave me 88,572. So that should be correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify with a smaller version. Let's take a smaller expression to test. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the sequence a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, then 3*a_3=120. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I count the layers: innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, so 3 layers inside the outer 3, leading to 3*a_3=120. <nEwLiNe>So in the original problem, there are 9 layers inside the outer 3, so a_1 to a_9, then 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So a_1=4, a_2=13, a_3=40, a_4=121, a_5=364, a_6=1093, a_7=3280, a_8=9841, a_9=29524. Then 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer should be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial calculation, I went all the way to a_10=88573, then multiplied by 3 to get 265,719, but that was incorrect because I had an extra layer. <nEwLiNe>So to be precise, the original expression has 9 layers of 1 + 3(...), starting from the innermost, so a_1 to a_9, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Hence, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute it step by step again to confirm. <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost first: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion came from miscounting the number of layers. Initially, I thought there were 10 layers, but actually, there are 9 layers inside the outermost 3, leading to the correct result of 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing the pattern as a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3 times the previous, it's a linear recurrence relation rather than a simple geometric series. <nEwLiNe>But step-by-step computation seems more straightforward here, especially since the number of layers isn't too large. <nEwLiNe>So, to recap, each layer is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>Start with 4, <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), <nEwLiNe>After 9 layers, we get 29,524, <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3 to get the final result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. So I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed step by step by evaluating each nested parentheses starting from the innermost layer. Each layer is of the form \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous result)}\). After computing each layer, the final result is obtained by multiplying the last layer by 3.  <nEwLiNe>Here are the key steps: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply the last result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 29524 = 88572\) <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \(\boxed{88572}\"
