Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a series of 3s and 1s with a lot of multiplications and additions. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.
First, I notice that the expression is a chain of operations where each step seems to be 1 plus 3 times something. So it's like a recursive structure. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested parentheses.
Let me write down the expression from the inside out:
Start with the innermost part: (1 + 3). Then each layer wraps that result with 3*(1 + ...). Let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's another 3*(1 + ...). Let me see:
1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4
2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15
3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48
4. Then: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147
5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444
6. Then: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335
7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008
8. Then: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027
9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084
10. Finally: 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I count the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Each time, starting from the innermost, I need to compute each layer step by step.
Let me list each layer one by one:
1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4
2. Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15
3. Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48
4. Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147
5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444
6. Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335
7. Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008
8. Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027
9. Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084
Wait, so after 9 layers, Layer9 is 36084. But the original expression is 3*(1 + Layer9). So I think I missed that final multiplication by 3.
So, after computing Layer9, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085.
Let me compute that: 36085 * 3.
First, 36000*3 = 108000, and 85*3=255. So adding together, 108000 + 255 = 108255.
So, the total is 108255.
But wait, let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake in multiplication or addition.
Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.
Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.
Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct.
Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. 49*3: 40*3=120, 9*3=27, so 120+27=147. Correct.
Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct.
Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct.
Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct.
Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct.
Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000+84=36084. Correct.
Finally, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085. Let me compute 36085*3 again.
36085*3: Break it down:
30000*3 = 90000
6000*3 = 18000
80*3 = 240
5*3 = 15
Now add them all together:
90000 + 18000 = 108000
108000 + 240 = 108240
108240 + 15 = 108255.
Yes, that's correct. So the final result is 108255.
Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to compute this. Perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions.
Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on up to a_9, and then the final result is 3*(1 + a_9).
But actually, each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4.
This is a recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n.
The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4.
This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me solve it.
First, write the recurrence:
a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1
This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.
The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.
Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p.
Substitute into the recurrence:
a_p = 3*a_p + 1
Solve for a_p:
a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2.
So the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2.
Use the initial condition to find A. When n=1, a_1 = 4.
So,
4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2
Add 1/2 to both sides:
4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2.
Thus, the general solution is:
a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2.
Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2.
Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.
Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524.
Wait, hold on. Earlier, when computing step by step, I got a_9 as 36084, but according to this formula, a_9 is 29524. That's a discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let me check my step-by-step computation again.
Wait, perhaps my indexing is off. The formula says a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if n=1, a_1 should be (3^2 -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, which matches. Then, a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 26/2=13. But when I computed step by step, a_2 was 15.
Wait, that's conflicting. So either my formula is wrong, or my step-by-step computation is wrong.
Wait, in the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, for n=1: 4, which matches. For n=2: (27 -1)/2=13, but when I computed step by step, a_2 was 15.
Hmm, that suggests that my formula is incorrect. Maybe I misapplied the recurrence.
Wait, the original recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, for n=2, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13. Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had Layer2 as 15. That was incorrect.
Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine my step-by-step computation.
I think I messed up the layers. Let me write down the layers again, carefully.
Original expression:
3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))
So, starting from the innermost:
Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4
Layer2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13
Wait, earlier I thought Layer2 was 3*(1 + Layer1). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + ...). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). But in the formula, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but in the actual expression, each layer is 3*(1 + something). Wait, maybe my indexing is different.
Wait, in the formula, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, but in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So perhaps the formula is not directly applicable because the expression is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), but the formula I derived was a_n =1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, they are different.
Wait, perhaps my confusion comes from whether the expression is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) or a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, let's clarify.
Looking at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I define b_n as the value after n layers, then b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}).
Wait, so actually, b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}).
But in my initial formula, I set a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.
So, let me redefine:
Let b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}), with b_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12.
Wait, no. Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3) =4. Then the next layer is 3*(1 +4)=15. So, actually, starting from b_1 =4, then b_2=3*(1 + b_1)=15, b_3=3*(1 + b_2)=3*(16)=48, etc.
So, in this case, the recurrence is b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}), with b_1=4.
So, to find a general formula for b_n, we have:
b_n = 3*(1 + b_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*b_{n-1}
So, the recurrence is b_n = 3*b_{n-1} + 3, with b_1=4.
This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence. Let's solve it.
First, write the homogeneous equation: b_n - 3*b_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 =0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n.
Now, find a particular solution. The nonhomogeneous term is 3, a constant. So, let's assume a particular solution is a constant, say b_p.
Substitute into the recurrence:
b_p = 3*b_p + 3
Solve for b_p:
b_p - 3*b_p = 3 => -2*b_p =3 => b_p= -3/2.
Thus, the general solution is b_n = C*3^n - 3/2.
Apply initial condition: when n=1, b_1=4.
So,
4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5
Add 1.5 to both sides:
5.5 = 3C => C=5.5/3=11/6.
Thus, the general solution is b_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.
Simplify:
(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2.
Wait, but let's just keep it as (11/6)*3^n - 3/2.
Alternatively, factor out 1/2:
= (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6.
So, b_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6.
Now, let's test for n=1:
b_1 = (11*3 -9)/6 = (33 -9)/6=24/6=4. Correct.
n=2:
b_2 = (11*9 -9)/6=(99 -9)/6=90/6=15. Correct.
n=3:
b_3 = (11*27 -9)/6=(297 -9)/6=288/6=48. Correct.
n=4:
b_4 = (11*81 -9)/6=(891 -9)/6=882/6=147. Correct.
So, the formula works.
Therefore, for n=9 layers:
b_9 = (11*3^9 -9)/6.
Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.
Thus, b_9 = (11*19683 -9)/6.
Compute numerator:
11*19683: Let's compute 10*19683=196830, plus 1*19683=19683, total=196830 +19683=216513.
Subtract 9: 216513 -9=216504.
Divide by 6: 216504 /6.
Compute 216504 รท6:
6*36000=216000. So 216504 -216000=504.
504 รท6=84.
So total is 36000 +84=36084.
Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, b_9=36084.
Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(1 + b_9)=3*(1 +36084)=3*36085=108255.
So, the final answer is 108255.
Wait, but earlier when I tried to use the a_n formula, I got a different result because I misapplied the recurrence. But with the correct formula for b_n, I get the same result as my step-by-step computation.
Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 108255.
Just to recap:
1. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).
2. Starting from the innermost layer, compute each layer step by step.
3. Alternatively, model it as a recurrence relation and find a closed-form formula to compute the nth layer.
4. Both methods lead to the same result, confirming that the final value is 108255.
So, I think I've double-checked my work and can be confident in the answer.
