Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards, it will make more sense.
Okay, so starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 
1 + 3 is 4. So, that simplifies the innermost part. Now, moving one layer out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). Let me substitute the innermost part with 4.
So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. 
1 + 3*4. Wait, multiplication comes before addition, right? So, 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13. Okay, so that layer simplifies to 13.
Now, moving out another layer, we have another (1 + 3*(...)). Let me plug in the previous result here. So, it's 1 + 3*13.
Again, multiplication first: 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. Alright, so this layer becomes 40.
Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Let's compute that.
3*40 is 120, and 1 + 120 is 121. So, that simplifies to 121.
Next layer: 1 + 3*(121). Let's do the multiplication first. 3*121 is 363, then 1 + 363 is 364. Hmm, that's a big number.
Moving on, the next layer is 1 + 3*(364). Let's calculate 3*364. Hmm, 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, and 3*4 is 12. So, adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. Okay, so that layer is 1093.
Next up, another layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute 3*1093. 1093*3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 is 3280. That's a hefty number.
Continuing, the next layer is 1 + 3*(3280). Let's calculate 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 is 9841. Wow, that's getting big.
Next, another layer: 1 + 3*(9841). Let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524.
Wait a second, hold on. Let me check that calculation again because 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So, adding 27000 + 2400 is indeed 29400, then +120 is 29520, +3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. Okay, that seems right.
Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3*(29524). Let's compute 3*29524. Let me break it down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, +1500 is 88500, +60 is 88560, +12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573.
Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify 29524*3. Maybe I should compute it directly:
29524
x    3
-------
Let's compute:
4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1.
2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7.
5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1.
9*3 = 27 +1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2.
2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8.
So, 29524*3 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. Okay, so that's correct.
Now, moving out to the next layer, which is 1 + 3*(88573). Let's compute 3*88573. Hmm, that's going to be a big number. Let me compute it step by step.
88573 * 3:
3*3 = 9, write down 9.
7*3 = 21, write down 1, carryover 2.
5*3 = 15 + 2 = 17, write down 7, carryover 1.
8*3 = 24 +1 = 25, write down 5, carryover 2.
8*3 = 24 +2 = 26, write down 6, carryover 2.
Wait, hold on, 8 is the next digit, but there's a carryover of 2. So, 8*3 =24 +2=26. So, write down 6, carryover 2. But since there are no more digits, we write down the 2 as well. So, it becomes 265719.
Wait, let me verify:
88573 * 3:
Starting from the right:
3*3 = 9
3*7 =21, carryover 2, write 1
3*5 =15 +2=17, carryover 1, write 7
3*8=24 +1=25, carryover 2, write 5
3*8=24 +2=26, write 6 and carryover 2, but since there are no more digits, write 26 as 26.
Wait, so actually, the multiplication would be:
      88573
    x     3
    --------
      265719
Yes, that's correct. So, 3*88573 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720.
Wait, so the next layer is 1 + 265719, which is 265720.
Now, moving out another layer, we have 3*(265720). Wait, no, hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3*(the result of the innermost expression). But wait, let's make sure.
Wait, let me recount the layers because I might have miscounted.
Starting from the innermost (1+3) =4.
Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me list them:
1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4
2. Next: 1 + 3*4 =13
3. Next: 1 + 3*13=40
4. Next:1 +3*40=121
5. Next:1 +3*121=364
6. Next:1 +3*364=1093
7. Next:1 +3*1093=3280
8. Next:1 +3*3280=9841
9. Next:1 +3*9841=29524
10. Next:1 +3*29524=88573
11. Next:1 +3*88573=265720


Wait, so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers of 1 + 3*(...). So, after computing up to 265720, that's the result inside the outermost parentheses. So, the entire expression is 3*(265720). So, let's compute that.
3*265720. Let me calculate that. 265720*3.
Compute 200000*3=600000
60000*3=180000
5000*3=15000
700*3=2100
20*3=60
0*3=0
Wait, no, that's breaking down 265720. Let me do it digit by digit:
265720 *3:
0*3=0
2*3=6
7*3=21, write down 1, carryover 2
5*3=15 +2=17, write down7, carryover1
6*3=18 +1=19, write down9, carryover1
2*3=6 +1=7
So, writing it down:
265720
x     3
-------
797160
Yes, that seems correct. So, 265720*3 is 797160.
Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 797160.
Wait, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.
Starting from the inside:
1. (1+3)=4
2. 1 + 3*4=1+12=13
3.1 + 3*13=1+39=40
4.1 + 3*40=1+120=121
5.1 + 3*121=1+363=364
6.1 + 3*364=1+1092=1093
7.1 + 3*1093=1+3279=3280
8.1 + 3*3280=1+9840=9841
9.1 + 3*9841=1+29523=29524
10.1 + 3*29524=1+88572=88573
11.1 + 3*88573=1+265719=265720
Then, the outermost multiplication: 3*265720=797160.
Yes, that seems consistent. So, I think 797160 is the correct answer.
Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, each term is 1 + 3*a_n where a_n is the previous term. So, starting with a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40, and so on.
This seems like a geometric sequence or something similar. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula for the nth term.
Given that each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1=4.
This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it.
The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution.
The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1}=0, which has the characteristic equation r -3=0, so r=3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.
For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say C.
Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C
Solving for C: C - 3*C =1 => -2*C=1 => C= -1/2.
Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n -1/2.
Using the initial condition a_1=4:
4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A=4 +1/2=9/2 => A=(9/2)/3=3/2.
Therefore, the general term is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2.
So, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.
Let me test this formula with the earlier terms.
For n=1: (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=8/2=4. Correct.
n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=26/2=13. Correct.
n=3: (3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct.
n=4: (3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct.
n=5: (3^6 -1)/2=(729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct.
Great, so the formula seems to hold.
So, in our problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of 1+3(...) layers.
Starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.
Looking at the original expression:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
Each 1 + 3( adds another layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:
1. 3(1 + 3(...
2. 3(1 + 3(...
3. 3(1 + 3(...
4. 3(1 + 3(...
5. 3(1 + 3(...
6. 3(1 + 3(...
7. 3(1 + 3(...
8. 3(1 + 3(...
9. 3(1 + 3(...
So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the innermost is a_1=4, and the outermost is a_9.
Using the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1} -1)/2.
Therefore, a_9=(3^{10} -1)/2.
Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049.
So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.
Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, I got a_9=29524. Then, the next layer is 1 + 3*a_9=1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573, which is a_{10}=88573.
Wait, but according to the formula, a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2. So, if we have 9 layers, n=9, a_9=29524, which is correct. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9)=3*a_{10}, where a_{10}=(3^{11}-1)/2=(177147 -1)/2=177146/2=88573, which matches our step-by-step computation.
Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}=3*(88573)=265719. Wait, hold on, no. Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719.
Wait, but earlier, when I computed step by step, the last step was 3*265720=797160. Wait, but according to the formula, a_{10}=88573, so 3*a_{10}=265719. But in my step-by-step, I had 1 + 3*a_9=265720, then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. So, which is correct?
Wait, let's clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13, a_3=40,..., up to a_9=29524, then a_{10}=1 + 3*a_9=1 + 3*29524=1 + 88572=88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719.
But when I computed step-by-step earlier, I went up to 265720 and then multiplied by 3 to get 797160. Wait, that must be incorrect.
Wait, hold on. Let me recount.
Original expression:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
So, starting from the innermost (1+3)=4.
Then, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's count how many layers there are:
Each 1 + 3( adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3:
1. 3(1 + 3(...
2. 3(1 + 3(...
3. 3(1 + 3(...
4. 3(1 + 3(...
5. 3(1 + 3(...
6. 3(1 + 3(...
7. 3(1 + 3(...
8. 3(1 + 3(...
9. 3(1 + 3(...
So, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13,..., a_9=29524. Then, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9)=3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*(1 + 88572)=3*88573=265719.
But in my earlier step-by-step, I had 11 layers, going up to 265720, which was incorrect. I think I miscounted the number of layers.
Wait, let's look at the original expression again:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...):
Starting from the innermost:
1. (1 + 3)
Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Let's count:
- The first 3 is followed by (1 + 3(...)), which is one layer.
Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), so that's two layers.
Continuing, the expression is:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3(...) adds a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3:
1. 3(1 + 3(
2. 3(1 + 3(
3. 3(1 + 3(
4. 3(1 + 3(
5. 3(1 + 3(
6. 3(1 + 3(
7. 3(1 + 3(
8. 3(1 + 3(
9. 3(1 + 3(
So, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the innermost is a_1=4, then a_2=13,..., up to a_9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*a_9)=3*a_{10}=3*88573=265719.
But in my initial step-by-step computation, I went one layer further, which was incorrect. So, I think the correct answer is 265719, not 797160.
Wait, but let's see. Maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write out the expression with indices:
Let me denote the innermost as layer 1: (1 + 3) =4.
Then layer 2:1 +3*(layer1)=13.
Layer3:1 +3*(layer2)=40.
Layer4:1 +3*(layer3)=121.
Layer5:1 +3*(layer4)=364.
Layer6:1 +3*(layer5)=1093.
Layer7:1 +3*(layer6)=3280.
Layer8:1 +3*(layer7)=9841.
Layer9:1 +3*(layer8)=29524.
Layer10:1 +3*(layer9)=88573.
Wait, so actually, the expression is 3*(layer10). So, the layers go up to 10, meaning the entire expression is 3*(88573)=265719.
But in my initial step-by-step, I thought there were 9 layers, but actually, there are 10 layers. Wait, no, let's clarify.
Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))
Counting the number of 1 + 3*(...) sections:
Starting from the innermost, each 1 + 3( adds a new layer. Let's count:
1. (1 + 3)
2. (1 + 3(...))
3. (1 + 3(...))
Continuing until the outermost.
But in the original expression, the number of opening parentheses after the first 3 is 9, as previously counted. So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Therefore, there are 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, the innermost is layer1=4, then layer2=13,..., layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*layer9)=3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*88573=265719.
But when I was computing step-by-step earlier, I went beyond that to layer10=265720, which is incorrect because the original expression only has 9 layers inside the first 3*(...). So, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I continued one layer too far.
Wait, but when I computed up to 265720, that was after 11 layers, which would mean the original expression has 11 layers, but actually, it's only 9.
Wait, let me recount the number of layers in the original expression.
Original expression:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))
Let me count the number of 1 + 3( sections:
Starting from the first 3, each subsequent (1 + 3 adds a layer. Let's see:
- 3(1 + 3(...
- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(...
So, each ( after the first 3 adds a layer. Let's count the number of ( after the first 3:
1. 3(1 + 3(
2. 3(1 + 3(
3. 3(1 + 3(
4. 3(1 + 3(
5. 3(1 + 3(
6. 3(1 + 3(
7. 3(1 + 3(
8. 3(1 + 3(
9. 3(1 + 3(
So, 9 layers. Therefore, the innermost is layer1=4, and the outermost layer is layer9=29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*layer9)=3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*88573=265719.
Therefore, the correct answer should be 265719.
But earlier, when I computed step-by-step, I went beyond that, getting 265720 and then 797160, which is incorrect because I added an extra layer. So, I need to correct that.
Therefore, the correct computation is:
Layer1: (1 + 3) =4
Layer2:1 +3*4=13
Layer3:1 +3*13=40
Layer4:1 +3*40=121
Layer5:1 +3*121=364
Layer6:1 +3*364=1093
Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280
Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841
Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524
Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*(1 + 88572)=3*88573=265719.
Yes, that's correct.
Alternatively, using the formula a_n=(3^{n+1}-1)/2, where n=9 layers:
a_9=(3^{10}-1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524.
Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*(1 + 88572)=3*88573=265719.
Therefore, the answer is 265719.
But wait, earlier I thought I had 11 layers, which was a mistake. So, the correct answer is 265719.
But to be thorough, let me write down each layer step-by-step correctly:
1. Layer1: (1 + 3)=4
2. Layer2:1 +3*4=13
3. Layer3:1 +3*13=40
4. Layer4:1 +3*40=121
5. Layer5:1 +3*121=364
6. Layer6:1 +3*364=1093
7. Layer7:1 +3*1093=3280
8. Layer8:1 +3*3280=9841
9. Layer9:1 +3*9841=29524
Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*29524)=3*(1 + 88572)=3*88573=265719.
Yes, that's correct. So, my initial confusion was due to miscounting the layers, but now it's clear.
Therefore, the final answer is 265719.
But wait, let me verify this with another approach. Let me compute the expression step-by-step from the innermost:
Start with (1 + 3)=4.
Then, next layer:1 + 3*4=1 +12=13.
Next:1 +3*13=1 +39=40.
Next:1 +3*40=1 +120=121.
Next:1 +3*121=1 +363=364.
Next:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093.
Next:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280.
Next:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841.
Next:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524.
Now, the expression is 3*(1 +3*29524)=3*(1 +88572)=3*88573.
Compute 3*88573:
88573*3:
3*3=9
3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2
3*5=15 +2=17, write7, carryover1
3*8=24 +1=25, write5, carryover2
3*8=24 +2=26, write6, carryover2
Since there are no more digits, write2.
So, 88573*3=265719.
Yes, that's correct.
Therefore, the final answer is 265719.
I think that's consistent now. So, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 265719.
</think>
The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost term, each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. After simplifying each layer, the outermost multiplication by 3 yields the final result.
