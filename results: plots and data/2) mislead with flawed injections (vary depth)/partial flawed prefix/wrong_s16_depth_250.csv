Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's see. The innermost part is 1 + 3. So, let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Now, moving one level out, we have another 1 + 3 multiplied by that result. Wait, actually, let me parse this correctly. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous result).  <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step. Maybe if I denote each level as a term, it'll be clearer. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + Level1) <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, wait, actually, hold on. Is each layer 3*(1 + previous layer) or is it 3*(1 + something else? Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). So, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the final result is 36084? Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. But wait, let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression has multiple layers. Let me count the number of 3s to see how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 adds a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))))) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))))))) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Yes, so there are 9 layers. So, my calculation above with 9 layers is correct. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 3. Wait, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous). Let me see if there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. If each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4, then we can write this recursively. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, it's clear that each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, the recursive formula is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can solve this recurrence relation. It's a linear recurrence, non-homogeneous. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, we need a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3C - 3/2 => 3C = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check if this works for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - 3/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9, the value is: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9 first. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280*11 = 36080, and 0.5*11=5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>So, (11/6)*19683 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3/2 = 1.5. <nEwLiNe>So, 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier step-by-step calculation. Therefore, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the arithmetic. 3^9 is indeed 19683 because 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, and 3^9 is 19683. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 19683 divided by 6: 19683 / 6. Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 19 three times (3*6=18), remainder 1. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 16. 6 goes into 16 twice (2*6=12), remainder 4. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 8: 48. 6 goes into 48 eight times, no remainder. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 3: 3. 6 goes into 3 zero times, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11: <nEwLiNe>3280 * 11: 3280*10=32800, plus 3280*1=3280, total 36080. <nEwLiNe>0.5*11=5.5. <nEwLiNe>Total: 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have noticed that each step is 3*(1 + previous) which can be rewritten as 3 + 3*previous. So, starting from 4: <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3 + 3*147 = 3 + 441 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3 + 3*444 = 3 + 1332 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3 + 3*1335 = 3 + 4005 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3 + 3*4008 = 3 + 12024 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3 + 3*12027 = 3 + 36081 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Same result. So, regardless of the method, the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any addition errors, let me verify a few steps again. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>All steps are consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about this is to recognize the pattern as a geometric series with each term multiplied by 3 and added 3 each time. However, since it's a linear recurrence, the closed-form solution is more efficient, but since we only have 9 layers, step-by-step computation is manageable. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can write out all the layers in a table to visualize: <nEwLiNe>Layer | Value <nEwLiNe>1 | 4 <nEwLiNe>2 | 15 <nEwLiNe>3 | 48 <nEwLiNe>4 | 147 <nEwLiNe>5 | 444 <nEwLiNe>6 | 1335 <nEwLiNe>7 | 4008 <nEwLiNe>8 | 12027 <nEwLiNe>9 | 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, this table shows the progression clearly, and each value is obtained by multiplying the previous value by 3 and adding 3, which is consistent with the recurrence relation a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, after careful computation and verification, I conclude that the value of the given expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each step involves multiplying 3 by (1 plus the result of the next innermost expression). By systematically computing each layer, we find that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a recursive expression where each level adds 1 and multiplies by 3. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that there are nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because the innermost one doesn't have any other parentheses inside it, so it's the simplest. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression structure: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. <nEwLiNe> <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, wait, is that right? Wait, no, because the Layer 2 is actually (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). Wait, hold on, maybe I misread the structure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)). Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and so on, up to Layer 9, which is the outermost one, but the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the entire expression is 3*(something), where that something is 1 + 3*(another something), and so on. So, maybe it's 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3(...) parts. Starting from the left: 3(...), and inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count them. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested deeper. Let's count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) - that's 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), each nested inside the previous one, and then the entire thing is multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, maybe I can compute each layer starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3), and work my way outwards. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let me compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400 + 120 = 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*29524. Let me compute that again: 29524*3. 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression, which could have saved me from computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me plug in the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^{1} + B = 3A + B. <nEwLiNe>Assume the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. The homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}, and the particular solution can be found as a constant. Let me assume a particular solution is a constant A. Then, substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the value I got earlier for Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which is the same as before. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to compute it, using the closed-form formula derived from the recurrence relation. It's much faster and avoids computing each layer step by step, especially if there were more layers. <nEwLiNe>But since we only had 9 layers, computing each step was manageable, but it's good to know the formula in case the number of layers increases. <nEwLiNe>So, in summary, the expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. I need to figure out how to approach this.  <nEwLiNe>First off, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Maybe I can compute this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That makes sense because parentheses indicate the order of operations, so innermost ones should be calculated first. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the structure to visualize it better. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3 times the result of the previous layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer out: <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Hmm, let me correct that. So Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check if I'm doing this right. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses to see how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So that's 9 layers, right? So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Layer 1: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire nested expression. Wait, hold on, in my labeling, Layer 1 was the outermost 3*(...). So actually, the computation I did is already computing the entire expression. So the result would be 36084. Hmm, let me verify this because it seems like a big number. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I should write out each step more carefully: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. That seems correct if each step is computed properly. Let me double-check a couple of layers to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>For example, Layer 6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. That's correct because 3*49 is 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3 is 444, right? Yes, because 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; 300+120=420, 420+24=444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4000*3=12,000, 9*3=27. So 12,000 + 27 = 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let's compute 12,000*3=36,000, 28*3=84. So 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Perfect. <nEwLiNe>So, all layers check out, and the arithmetic seems correct. Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions to avoid computing each layer manually, especially if the number of layers increases. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>The expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))). Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). If I denote the value of the nth layer as a_n, then the recurrence relation would be a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in my earlier computation, I considered a_9 = 4, and each subsequent layer built upon that. But if I were to model it as a recurrence, starting from the innermost, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 15, and so on, up to a_9 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But maybe I can express this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can expand this: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each a_n is 3 more than a multiple of 3. Wait, let me think differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solve for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 => -2*K = 3 => K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, general solution: a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1.5 => 3*C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Because 3/2 = 9/6, so subtracting gives (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, which is our case, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 10*19683 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>Then add 1*19683: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 / 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>So, 216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 / 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084, which matches the earlier step-by-step computation. That's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the recurrence relation and solve it to find a closed-form expression, I end up with the same result: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, maybe I can compute a couple more layers using the formula to see if it still holds. <nEwLiNe>For example, take n = 2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^2 - 9)/6 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, which matches. <nEwLiNe>n = 3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n = 4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works for the first few layers, so I'm confident it's correct for n = 9 as well. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning or calculations. Each step checks out, and both the step-by-step computation and the recurrence relation approach lead to the same result. So, I'm confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a repeated pattern with 1s and 3s. Maybe I can find a pattern or simplify it step by step. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer wraps another 1 + 3 multiplied by 3.

Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, the structure is that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). So, starting from Layer 9, which is the innermost, it's 1 + 3.

Let's parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, counting the number of layers, each ""1 + 3*"" is a new layer, starting from the innermost.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) It looks like a bunch of nested parentheses with 3s and 1s. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me try to figure out how to approach this. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It looks like a recursive or iterative process where each layer is similar to the one before. Maybe I can compute it starting from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a good plan because otherwise, trying to compute everything at once might be too confusing. <nEwLiNe>So, let me start by identifying the innermost part. Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one step out, the <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on. No, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 + the next layer). So, perhaps I should think of each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. So, is that the final answer? Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Yes. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. That's right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Hmm, 445*3. Let me compute that again. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200 + 120 +15= 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000 + 900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000 +27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000 +84=36084. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is building on the previous one, each time multiplying by 3 after adding 1. So, each step, the value is tripling and then adding 3? Hmm, let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, each layer is 3 more than triple the previous? Or is it 3*(1 + something). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>If I denote each layer as L1, L2, L3,... L9, then: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>L3=3*(1 + L2)=3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>L4=3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>And so on. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the recurrence relation is Ln = 3*(1 + Ln-1). Interesting. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's a pattern or formula for such a recurrence relation. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: Ln = 3*(1 + Ln-1) <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: Ln = 3 + 3*Ln-1 <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation where each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's solve the homogeneous equation: Ln - 3*Ln-1 = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Ln^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say Ln^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3A <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3A from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-A = 3 <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = -3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>Ln = C*3^n + (-3) <nEwLiNe>Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. Let's see, when n=1, L1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, substituting n=1: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 3 <nEwLiNe>Add 3 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>7 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Thus, C = 7/3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>Ln = (7/3)*3^n - 3 = 7*3^{n-1} - 3 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with n=1: <nEwLiNe>Ln = 7*3^{0} -3 = 7*1 -3=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>7*3^{1} -3=21 -3=18. Wait, but earlier we had L2=15. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I make a mistake? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check my recurrence relation again. The recurrence is Ln = 3*(1 + Ln-1), which is Ln = 3 + 3*Ln-1. <nEwLiNe>But when I wrote the general solution, I had Ln = C*3^n + (-3). Maybe I made a mistake in the particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let me re-derive the particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Assume Ln^p = A, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>So, A - 3*A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Ah! I see, I must have made a mistake earlier. The particular solution should be A = -3/2, not -3. <nEwLiNe>So, correcting that, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>Ln = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition L1=4. <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Thus, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>Ln = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, Ln = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this with n=1: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^{0} -3)/2 = (11 -3)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^{1} -3)/2=(33 -3)/2=30/2=15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>(11*9 -3)/2=(99 -3)/2=96/2=48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>(11*27 -3)/2=(297 -3)/2=294/2=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for Layer n, Ln = (11*3^{n-1} -3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Since our layers go from n=1 to n=9, we can compute L9: <nEwLiNe>L9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>Compute 10*6561=65610, plus 1*6561=6561, total=65610 +6561=72171. <nEwLiNe>Then, 72171 -3=72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 /2=36084. <nEwLiNe>So, L9=36084, which matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about this is recognizing that the expression is a geometric series, but given the structure, it's more of a nested multiplication. But since we derived a formula for Ln, and it's consistent with the step-by-step computation, I feel confident that the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me recap the steps: <nEwLiNe>1. Identify the innermost parentheses and compute it. <nEwLiNe>2. Use the result to compute the next outer parentheses, and so on, layer by layer. <nEwLiNe>3. Notice the pattern and derive a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>4. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>5. Use the closed-form expression to compute the outermost layer directly. <nEwLiNe>6. Verify the result by both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Both methods led me to the same answer, so I can be pretty sure that 36084 is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses and threes. It looks like a nested expression with multiple layers. I need to figure out a way to simplify this step by step. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It seems like each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression more clearly, labeling each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n+1). Hmm, maybe I need to think about it differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 plus another similar expression). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Layer 4 is 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Layer 5 is 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Layer 6 is 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Layer 7 is 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Layer 8 is 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Layer 9 is 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Wait, but the original expression has 9 layers, right? Let me count: starting from the innermost (1+3) as Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have 9 layers, the final result should be Layer 9, which is 36084. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Explanation:** <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested structure with multiple layers.

Maybe my initial approach is correct after all. But I'm a bit unsure because I expected the number to be larger. Let me try another approach to verify. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can recognize that each layer follows a pattern. Let's see if there's a formula or a pattern I can use to calculate the value without computing each layer individually. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>It seems like each layer's value is increasing significantly. Maybe there's a geometric progression or some other pattern here. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can write a general formula for the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>Let’s define L_n as the value of layer n. <nEwLiNe>Given that: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relationship. It looks similar to a geometric series, but with each term depending on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>I recall that for such recursive relationships, the closed-form solution can be found using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to derive a general formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>Given: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. To solve it, I can use the method for solving linear recurrence relations. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the homogeneous part: <nEwLiNe>L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>The associated homogeneous recurrence relation is: <nEwLiNe>L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is: <nEwLiNe>r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution to the homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, we need a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. <nEwLiNe>Since the non-homogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution L_n^{(p)} = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = L_n^{(h)} + L_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's verify this formula with the earlier computed layers. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>L_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=3: <nEwLiNe>L_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=4: <nEwLiNe>L_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=5: <nEwLiNe>L_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=6: <nEwLiNe>L_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=7: <nEwLiNe>L_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=8: <nEwLiNe>L_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n=9: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Great, the formula matches the earlier computations. So, the value of the entire expression is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought the answer was 36,084, but now I'm getting 29,524. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me check the original problem again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of layers, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is Layer 1 <nEwLiNe>Then each additional 3*(1 + ...) adds a layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>But in my first attempt, I thought the answer was 36,084. That must have been a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see. In my first approach, I computed Layer 9 as 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, Layer 9 should be 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Where is the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Ah, I think I see the mistake. In my first approach, I mistakenly took Layer 8 as 12,027, but according to the formula, Layer 8 is 9,841. <nEwLiNe>So, let's correct that. <nEwLiNe>Recomputing Layer 8 and beyond: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 = 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 9,841) = 3*9,842 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the formula, Layer 9 should be (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, there's a small discrepancy here. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Using the formula: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048/2 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>But when computing step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 = 9,841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 = 3*(1 + 9,841) = 3*9,842 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>There's a difference of 2. It seems like there's a miscalculation in the step-by-step approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check Layer 8 again. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19,683 - 1)/2 = 19,682/2 = 9,841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 9 = 3*(1 + 9,841) = 3*9,842 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, it should be 29,524. So, there's an inconsistency. <nEwLiNe>I think the error is in the step-by-step computation. Let's try to compute Layer 9 using the formula: <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer should be 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step computation had an error, likely due to a miscalculation in one of the layers. <nEwLiNe>In conclusion, using the derived formula, the value of the entire expression is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{29524}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that start with 1 plus something. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That makes sense because parentheses usually indicate the order of operations, so starting from the inside will help me break it down. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay, so counting the number of parentheses, it seems like there are nine layers here. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3(something). So starting from the inner <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on. Is that right? Let me check. So Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). Layer 1 is 4, so 1 + 4 is 5, multiplied by 3 is 15. Yeah, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is the final answer 36084? Hmm, let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So each step seems right. Let me think if there's another way to compute this, maybe using a formula instead of computing each layer step by step. It might be faster and reduce the chance of error. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). That looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the expression recursively. Let’s say E(n) represents the value of the expression with n layers. So, E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4. Then, E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, E(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 3*(1 + E(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 3*(1 + E(2)) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, this recursive formula is correct. <nEwLiNe>Now, can I find a closed-form formula for E(n)? Let me think. <nEwLiNe>The recursion is E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)), with E(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Because E(n) = 3*(1 + E(n-1)) = 3 + 3*E(n-1). So, yes, E(n) = 3*E(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution will be the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation E(n) = 3*E(n-1). The characteristic equation is r = 3, so the homogeneous solution is E_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution E_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is E(n) = E_h(n) + E_p(n) = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition E(1) = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1.5. <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*C => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form solution is E(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^n)/6 = (11*3^(n))/6. <nEwLiNe>So, E(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>E(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, E(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Now, in our problem, n is 9 because there are 9 layers. Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...)), with 9 layers of 3s. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is Layer 1, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, in total, how many layers are there? Let's count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>So, yes, n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, plug n=9 into the formula: <nEwLiNe>E(9) = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 10*19683 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>Then, add 19683: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504. <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, E(9) = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the same result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. That's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me recompute the step-by-step layers quickly: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. So, both methods give me 36,084. That must be the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 3s and 1s with a lot of additions and multiplications. I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down to visualize it better. Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Innermost part: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(something). So, let me break it down layer by layer. <nEwLiNe>First layer (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*(first layer) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*(second layer) <nEwLiNe>And this continues until the ninth layer, which is the outermost one, all multiplied by 3 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't match my initial thought. I think I confused the layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify. Each time, the expression is 1 + 3*(previous expression). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: 29000 * 3 = 87000, and 524 * 3 = 1572. So adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So writing it down: 88572. Yeah, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. After computing each layer, I end up with 88572 as the final result. <nEwLiNe>I think that makes sense.

Alright, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses!

Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built recursively. Each time, it's 3 times (1 plus another similar term).

That seems like a good strategy because each layer depends on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I see that the innermost part is (1 + 3). Then, each layer adds another 3 multiplied by a new ( <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + the next layer). Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should clarify the structure. Let me rewrite the entire expression with labels for each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>But actually, it's better to think of each layer as starting from the innermost. So, perhaps the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting with 4, then 3*(1+4)=15, then 3*(1+15)=48, and so on. So, if I follow this step by step, the results should be: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36,084. Hmm, that seems quite large, but each step multiplies by 3 and adds 3 each time, so it's exponential growth. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make an error in counting the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, from 1 to 9, that's 9 layers. So, Layer 1 is innermost, Layer 9 is outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, according to my calculations, Layer 9 is 36,084.

Each step, I'm multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3 more inside the parentheses. Wait, no, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous result). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, it's a geometric progression? Or maybe not, because each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12? Wait, no. Wait, hold on, actually, in my earlier breakdown, Layer 1 was just (1 + 3) = 4, but in reality, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So maybe I should redefine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I mislabeled the layers. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4.

So, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. Hmm. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let's consider that the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 3*(1 + previous). So, if we have n layers, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, with n=9, f(9)=36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for f(n). Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 3*(1 + f(n-1)) = 3 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: f(n) = 3*f(n-1). The solution is f_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is f(n) = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1.5 => 3*C = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333. <nEwLiNe>So, the general formula is f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1}) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>But let's compute it for n=9. <nEwLiNe>f(9) = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, f(9) = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>11 * 19683 = let's compute 10*19683 = 196,830 and 1*19683 = 19,683, so total is 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then, 216,513 / 6 = 36,085.5. <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3/2: 36,085.5 - 1.5 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, f(9) = 36,084. Which matches my step-by-step calculation earlier. So, that's a good confirmation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each step manually again: <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result each time. So, I think I can be confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>I guess another way to think about it is that each layer is effectively adding a term that's a power of 3 multiplied by 1, but I think the recurrence relation approach is more straightforward here. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent the entire expression as a sum of powers of 3. Let me try expanding it: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)). <nEwLiNe>If I expand it fully, each 1 inside is multiplied by 3 multiple times. Specifically, each 1 is multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think about that. The innermost 1 is multiplied by 3^8, the next one by 3^7, and so on, up to the outermost 1 multiplied by 3^0=1. Then, each 3 added inside is multiplied by 3^(k-1). Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me try to formalize this. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, <nEwLiNe>E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3))...)) <nEwLiNe>If I expand E, it would be: <nEwLiNe>E = 3*1 + 3*3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each term is 3 multiplied by 1, plus 3 multiplied by 3 multiplied by 1, and so on. So, in the end, E can be expressed as a sum of 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but I need to adjust for the initial 1s. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4 = 1 + 3^1 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*(1 + 1 + 3) = 3*(2 + 3) = 6 + 9 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems different. Alternatively, maybe each layer adds another term. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expansion. Let me try to write E as: <nEwLiNe>E = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... up to 9 terms? Wait, no, because each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, actually, each 1 is multiplied by 3 multiple times. <nEwLiNe>Wait, another approach: Let me note that each time, the expression is 3*(1 + previous). So, if I define E_n as the expression with n layers, then E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Given that, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no, earlier I considered E_1 as (1 + 3) = 4, but actually, each E_n is 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), starting from E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, the first layer is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to the ninth layer. <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers. So, for the innermost, it's just (1 + 3), which isn't multiplied by 3. Wait, actually, no, each layer is multiplied by 3 once. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should think of it as the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 multiplications by 3, since the innermost is (1 + 3). Wait, no, actually, each opening parenthesis introduces another multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the number of multiplications by 3 is equal to the number of layers. So, with 9 layers, we have 9 multiplications by 3. But that might not be the case. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the number of terms is 9, each being 3^k for k from 1 to 9, but adjusted for the additions. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try to write out the entire expression expanded. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, the expansion is multiplicative, not additive. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is a product of 3s and sums of 1s. It's not straightforward to express it as a simple geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, as we saw earlier, the recurrence relation gives us f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3, which solves to f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. For n=9, that gives 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result each time. I think that's solid. <nEwLiNe>I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by recursively evaluating each layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is calculated as 3 times (1 plus the result of the previous layer). Starting with the innermost value of 4, each subsequent layer is computed until the outermost layer is reached, resulting in the final value of 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 36,084 <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084}"
10,36084,0,0,2546,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 3s and 1s all multiplied together. I guess I need to solve this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write it down more clearly to see the structure better. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost part:  <nEwLiNe>The innermost expression is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So now, replacing that, the next layer is 3 times that result. Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the next layer is 3(1 + 3(...)), so after the innermost, it's 1 + 3*(result). Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should parse the expression properly. Let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing one, so <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4. Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Layer 3 would then be 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, I see a pattern here. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I can compute each layer step by step, multiplying by 3 each time, I can work my way up to the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so does that mean the entire expression simplifies to 36,084? Let me check my calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Still good. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Calculating 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. So 30000+6000=36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems to check out. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, maybe I can try computing it another way or see if there's a pattern or formula that could have been used instead of computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous result). So, this is a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + term_before). Let me denote the term at Layer n as a_n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9, which is the final result. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a particular solution is a constant C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 3/2 = (8/2 + 3/2) = 11/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/2)*3^{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, the formula works for the first few terms. So, in general, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^8 = 6561. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: <nEwLiNe>Compute 10*6561 = 65,610 <nEwLiNe>Compute 1*6561 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. Which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors when computing 11*6561. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: <nEwLiNe>6561 * 10 = 65,610 <nEwLiNe>6561 * 1 = 6,561 <nEwLiNe>Adding them: 65,610 + 6,561. <nEwLiNe>Let's add: <nEwLiNe>65,610 <nEwLiNe>+ 6,561 <nEwLiNe>= 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. Then subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods, step-by-step computation and using the recurrence relation with a closed-form formula, give me the same result: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together with addition. Hmm, let me see. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression for clarity, numbering each layer from the innermost to the outermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2.

Is Layer 2 just (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) or is it 3*(1 + Layer 1)? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, Layer 1 is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1). So Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Got it. So Layer 2 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084.

Total: 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding up: 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 20*3=60, 8*3=24. Adding up: 30000+6000=36000+60=36060+24=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step checks out. So the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step. Sometimes, recognizing a pattern can save time and reduce the chance of error. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 = 3 + 1 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 15 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 48 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3 + 45 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but 15*3=45, plus 3 is 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer n-1). <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous term. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the general form: <nEwLiNe>Let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we can write this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, because 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3*K + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 3 => -2K = 3 => K = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 1.5. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 => C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this expression: <nEwLiNe>First, note that 3^n = 3*3^{n-1}, so let's see: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11/2)*3^{n-1} - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (1/2)*(11*3^{n-1} - 3). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, let's test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*9 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*27 - 3)/2 = (297 - 3)/2 = 294/2 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>a_5 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: <nEwLiNe>a_6 = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: <nEwLiNe>a_7 = (11*729 - 3)/2 = (8019 - 3)/2 = 8016/2 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: <nEwLiNe>a_8 = (11*2187 - 3)/2 = (24057 - 3)/2 = 24054/2 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2 = (72171 - 3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works for all layers. Therefore, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, is 36084. <nEwLiNe>This matches the step-by-step computation I did earlier, so I can be confident that 36084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3*(1). Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, it's a geometric progression with a twist. <nEwLiNe>But since I already have the closed-form formula, I can directly compute a_9 without computing each layer. <nEwLiNe>But for thoroughness, I did both the step-by-step computation and derived the closed-form formula, both leading to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can conclude that the value of the given expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3)))))))))). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of nested expressions, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It looks like a recursive pattern where each layer is 1 + 3 times something. Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working my way up. That seems like a solid strategy because each step depends on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, let me write down the expression from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so now moving one layer out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times the result we just got. So that would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe> <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, no, wait. Let me check that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. I think I got confused earlier. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So it's not 3*(1 + previous), but 1 + 3*(previous). That's an important distinction. So let's correct that. <nEwLiNe>So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but the original expression is 3 times that entire nested expression. So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, the entire expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's do this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*9000 = 27000. Wait, no, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*20,000 = 60,000. <nEwLiNe>3*9,000 = 27,000. <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1,500. <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72. <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them all together: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 72 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intermediate steps. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each layer is 1 + 3 times the previous layer. So starting from 4, each step multiplies by 3 and adds 1. <nEwLiNe>So, after Layer 9, we have 29524, and then multiply by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer 9 again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*9841: 9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Wait, hold on, that's 29,523, not 29,524. Did I make a mistake here? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me compute 3*9841 properly. <nEwLiNe>9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Start from the units digit: 1*3=3. <nEwLiNe>Tens digit: 4*3=12. Write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>Hundreds digit: 8*3=24, plus the carried 1 is 25. Write down 5, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>Thousands digit: 9*3=27, plus the carried 2 is 29. Write down 9, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>Ten-thousands digit: 0*3=0, plus the carried 2 is 2. So, writing it all together: 29,523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so Layer 9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. That's correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572. So my final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 29,524 * 3 again. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88,572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me verify each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1,092 = 1,093. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3*364 is 1,092? Let me check: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 = 1,080 + 12 = 1,092. Yes, that's correct. So Layer 6 is 1,093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1,093. Let's compute 3*1,093. <nEwLiNe>1,000*3=3,000; 90*3=270; 3*3=9. So 3,000 + 270 = 3,270 + 9 = 3,279. Then 1 + 3,279 = 3,280. So Layer 7 is 3,280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3,280. Compute 3*3,280. <nEwLiNe>3,000*3=9,000; 200*3=600; 80*3=240. So 9,000 + 600 = 9,600 + 240 = 9,840. Then 1 + 9,840 = 9,841. So Layer 8 is 9,841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9,841. Compute 3*9,841. <nEwLiNe>9,000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 + 120 = 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. So Layer 9 is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29,524*3=88,572. Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors, let me compute 29,524 * 3 in another way. <nEwLiNe>Breaking down 29,524: <nEwLiNe>20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 24. <nEwLiNe>So, 20,000*3=60,000. <nEwLiNe>9,000*3=27,000. <nEwLiNe>500*3=1,500. <nEwLiNe>24*3=72. <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000. <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500. <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 72 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying each multiplication, I'm confident that the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. At first glance, it looks kind of intimidating because there are so many layers. But maybe if I break it down step by step, it won't be so bad. <nEwLiNe>Let me start by looking at the structure of the expression. It's a series of 3 multiplied by a sum, where each sum contains another 3 multiplied by another sum, and this pattern repeats multiple times. Specifically, I count nine sets of parentheses, each containing a 1 plus 3 times something. So, it's like a chain of these operations. <nEwLiNe>I think the key here is to work from the innermost parentheses outward. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting confused. Let me write it out as a series of nested expressions to make it clearer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So, Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, that seems right. Let me continue this way. <nEwLiNe>So, let's define each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the entire expression simplifies to 36,084? Hmm, let me verify that because that seems like a big number. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me go through each layer again to check: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Wait, 1 + 1335 is 1336, and 3*1336 is 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3. Let me compute that: 4000*3=12,000 and 9*3=27, so total is 12,027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12,027) = 3*12,028. Let's compute that: 12,000*3=36,000 and 28*3=84, so total is 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each layer checks out. So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to compute this. Maybe there's a formula or a pattern here. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation. Maybe I can solve it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given that, the general solution for such a linear recurrence can be found. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is because 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, where c=3 and d=3. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (a_1 + d/(c - 1)) * c^{n - 1} - d/(c - 1) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recall the formula for linear recurrences. For a recurrence relation like a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = c^{n - 1} * a_1 + d*(c^{n - 1} - 1)/(c - 1) <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the formula. Let me apply that here. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 4, c=3, d=3. <nEwLiNe>So, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3^{n - 1} * 4 + 3*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/(3 - 1) <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: <nEwLiNe>First, 3^{n - 1} * 4 is straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Second term: 3*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, combining both terms: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute that step by step. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*(3^{n - 1} - 1)/2: <nEwLiNe>= (3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 4*3^{n - 1} + (3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me factor out 3^{n - 1}: <nEwLiNe>= (4 + (3)/2) * 3^{n - 1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, let's combine the terms: <nEwLiNe>Convert 4*3^{n - 1} to have a denominator of 2: <nEwLiNe>= (8*3^{n - 1})/2 + (3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, combine the numerators: <nEwLiNe>= [8*3^{n - 1} + 3^{n} - 3]/2 <nEwLiNe>Note that 3^{n} = 3*3^{n - 1}, so: <nEwLiNe>= [8*3^{n - 1} + 3*3^{n - 1} - 3]/2 <nEwLiNe>= [11*3^{n - 1} - 3]/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form formula is a_n = (11*3^{n - 1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1 to see if it matches a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11*1 - 3)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 should be 15. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 should be 48. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, which is our case, a_9 = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*6561 - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: 10*6561=65,610; 1*6561=6,561. So total is 65,610 + 6,561 = 72,171. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3: 72,171 - 3 = 72,168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72,168 / 2 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, that matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. That gives me more confidence that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series. Each time, we're adding 3 times something, which is similar to a geometric progression with ratio 3. <nEwLiNe>But given that we already have a closed-form formula and verified it with two different methods, I think it's safe to conclude that the result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap: <nEwLiNe>1. I started by identifying the innermost parentheses and worked my way outward, computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>2. I noticed that each layer followed a recursive pattern, leading me to derive a closed-form formula for the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>3. I verified the formula with the initial layers to ensure it was correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Finally, I applied the formula to the 9th layer to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>This problem was a good exercise in handling nested expressions and recognizing recursive patterns. It also showed how useful it is to derive a general formula once a pattern is identified, as it can save time and reduce the chance of errors when dealing with multiple layers. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each step and verifying my work, I'm confident that the value of the given expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a recursive expression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Maybe I can solve this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I count nine sets of parentheses here. That means I need to start from the innermost one and work my way out. Let's break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost expression: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, use that result to compute the next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step <<INJECTED THINKING>> So, Layer 2 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me think again. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is multiplied by 3 after adding 1 and the result of the inner layer. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Hmm, maybe I need to correct that. <nEwLiNe>Let me redefine the layers properly: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So after computing Layer 9, I need to multiply it by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's make sure. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, actually, the layers are as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that's not correct. 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4? Wait, 20000 + 9000 is 29000, plus 500 is 29500, plus 20 is 29520, plus 4 is 29524.

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that looks pretty nested with all the parentheses. It's like a chain of operations starting from the innermost part and working outwards. I think I should start by evaluating the innermost expression first and then work my way outwards. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I notice that it's a series of 1 + 3 multiplied by 3 each time. Maybe there's a pattern here. Let me count how many times the 3(1 + ...) structure repeats. Starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(1 + ...). <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Actually, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Because in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So each layer is 1 + 3*(next inner layer). So actually, Layer 1 is (1 + 3). Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2).

Then, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, perhaps I can compute this expression step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses, and see if I reach the same result. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me compute the innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out: 3(1 + 4) = 3*5=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3(1 + 15)=3*16=48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, this is different from before.

So, why did I get a different result earlier when I tried computing step by step? Probably because I misapplied the order. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first alternative approach, I started computing as 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is correct, but I think I made a miscalculation there. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's do it again: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 3*(1 + 4)=3*5=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 15)=3*16=48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the previous method, it should be 13 here. Hmm, so which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, perhaps the confusion is arising because of the structure. Let me parse the expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, each time, it's 3*(1 + inner expression). Therefore, each step is multiplying by 3 after adding 1 to the inner result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the initial approach, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, E(n) = 1 + 3*E(n+1). So, starting from the innermost, E9=4, E8=1 + 3*4=13, etc., up to E1=29524, then the total expression is 3*E1=88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I parse it step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the previous method, it should be 13, 40, etc. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is arising because I'm miscounting the layers.

No, wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in my initial approach, I considered each layer as E(n)=1 + 3*E(n+1). So, E9=4, E8=1 + 3*4=13, E7=1 + 3*13=40, etc. <nEwLiNe>But in this step-by-step approach, I'm getting E=4, then 15, then 48, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the difference is because in the first approach, I'm treating each layer as 1 + 3*(next layer), whereas in the second approach, I'm treating it as 3*(1 + previous layer). These are two different interpretations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + inner). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E_innermost = (1 + 3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: E1 = 3*(1 + E_innermost)=3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer: E2=3*(1 + E1)=3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the initial approach, E8=13, which is 1 + 3*4=13, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which interpretation is correct? Let me clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3*(1 + ...)"" is a layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 =4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1)=3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2)=3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 + Layer3)=3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 + Layer4)=3*(1 +147)=444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 + Layer5)=3*(1 +444)=1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 + Layer6)=3*(1 +1335)=4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 + Layer7)=3*(1 +4008)=12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 + Layer8)=3*(1 +12027)=36084. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that contradicts the initial approach where I got 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial approach was wrong because I considered E(n)=1 + 3*E(n+1), but actually, the structure is E(n)=3*(1 + E(n+1)). So, starting from E9=4, E8=3*(1 +4)=15, E7=3*(1 +15)=48, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I follow this, then Layer9=4, Layer8=15, Layer7=48, Layer6=147, Layer5=444, Layer4=1335, Layer3=4008, Layer2=12027, Layer1=36084. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is Layer1=36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, that doesn't make sense because the original expression is 3*(...), so Layer1 is the outermost, which is 3*(...). So, if Layer1=36084, then the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But that contradicts my initial approach where I had 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so now I have two different results: 36084 and 88572. <nEwLiNe>Which one is correct? Let me try to compute it step by step carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost: (1 + 3) =4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out: 3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +147)=444. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +444)=1335. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +1335)=4008. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +4008)=12027. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +12027)=36084. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +36084)=108255. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression only has 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Wait, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, starting from the innermost (1 +3)=4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is Layer9=36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial approach, I had 88572. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because I misapplied the structure. The correct structure is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost. So, 9 layers, resulting in 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let's verify with smaller cases. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have a smaller expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost: (1 +3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer: 3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the initial approach, it would be: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression:3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>But according to the correct step-by-step, it's 147. <nEwLiNe>So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute the smaller expression manually: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>First, compute innermost: (1 +3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>But according to the initial approach, treating each layer as 1 +3*previous, starting from the innermost, we get 4,13,40, then 3*40=120, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the initial approach was incorrect. The correct way is to treat each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost. So, in the small example, it's 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=147, not 120. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the correct result is 36084, not 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I must have made a mistake in my initial approach by misapplying the structure. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let's check the small example again. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>Innermost:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +48)=147. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I compute as per the initial approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=40. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression:3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>But that's incorrect because the actual value is 147. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the initial approach was wrong. The correct way is to parse each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original problem, with 9 layers, the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let's confirm with another small example. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>Innermost:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Next:3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>So, total expression is 48. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, initial approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Total expression:3*13=39. <nEwLiNe>But actual value is 48. <nEwLiNe>So, initial approach is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the initial approach, I had 88572, but that was based on a misinterpretation of the structure. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, hold on. Let's clarify the structure again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a new layer, so 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: (1 +3)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result): <nEwLiNe>Layer1:4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:3*(1 +4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:3*(1 +15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the initial approach was wrong because I treated each layer as 1 + 3*previous, but the correct structure is 3*(1 + previous). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me compute it again step by step to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +4)=3*5=15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +15)=3*16=48. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +48)=3*49=147. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +147)=3*148=444. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027. <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the initial approach, I had 88572, which was based on a different interpretation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the accurate result. So, I conclude that the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is evaluated by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is computed as 3 times (1 plus the result of the next inner layer). After computing each layer step by step, the final result is found to be 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
16,88572,1,11,3169,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's rewrite the expression to see the structure better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses: the last one is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost part simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(innermost result) <nEwLiNe>Which <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, no, wait. Actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the entire inner expression. So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, after computing Layer 9, we have to multiply that result by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me recast this: <nEwLiNe>- Start with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>- Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3.  <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3:  <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication because it's easy to make an error with so many digits. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 60 + 12 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the layers. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each parenthesis corresponds to a layer, starting from the innermost. So, how many layers are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40 (Layer3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121 (Layer4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364 (Layer5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Layer6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Layer7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Layer8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Layer9) <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it step by step to ensure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern here. Each layer seems to follow the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 1 + 3*(Layer n-1) <nEwLiNe>With Layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for Layer n. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume the particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 4, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 13, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 121, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2 = 364, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: (3^7 -1)/2 = (2187 -1)/2 = 1093, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: (3^8 -1)/2 = (6561 -1)/2 = 3280, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: (3^9 -1)/2 = (19683 -1)/2 = 9841, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I can also check this using another approach, perhaps by expanding the expression step by step without using the formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving outward: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute this using a different method, perhaps by recognizing the pattern as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have 1 + 3*(previous term). So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>But in the formula, we found that Layer n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. So, for Layer9, it's (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>3^10 is 59049, so (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't see the pattern, I could compute each layer step by step as I did before, which also leads to the same result. <nEwLiNe>So, after verifying through multiple methods—step-by-step computation, using the recurrence relation, and recognizing the geometric series pattern—I can confidently say that the computed value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me try to figure this out. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with a 1 and then multiplied by 3, and then added to another term. It seems like a repeated pattern. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Compute \( <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, no. Let me correct that. Actually, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + something). So Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer 1). Since Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Okay, that makes sense. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the entire expression simplifies to 36084? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, each step seems correct. Each time, we're multiplying the sum by 3. It's like each layer is tripling the previous result and adding 3. So, the pattern is exponential, which makes sense why the numbers get large quickly. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, maybe there's a formula for this kind of expression. It looks similar to a geometric series or something. Let me think about that. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3, which is similar to a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Actually, the general form here is: each term a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). So, starting from a_1 = 4, then a_2 = 15, a_3 = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>This recurrence relation can be solved to find a closed-form expression. Let me try to find a pattern or formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>We have a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Expanding this, a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3*A = 3 => -2*A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Using the initial condition a_1 = 4, we can solve for C. <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3*C - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: 4 + 3/2 = 3*C => 11/2 = 3*C => C = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2) = (11/6)*3^n - (9/6) = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers, the value is (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me check what n corresponds to 9 layers. Since we started with Layer 1 as the innermost, which gave us a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, etc., up to a_9. So, n=9. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the formula: a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: 19683*10=196830, plus 19683 is 216513. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216504 / 6 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the same result as before. That confirms that the value is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, without using the recurrence relation, I could have just computed each layer step by step as I did initially, which also gave me 36084. So both methods agree. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\"

Okay, so I have this math problem to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. I think the best way is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of problems. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with the innermost part:  <nEwLiNe>The innermost expression is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4. Now, moving one level out, we have: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3(4) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check the original expression again. Hmm, actually, looking back, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4. Then the next one out is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should think of it as starting from the innermost and building up. <nEwLiNe>Let me define it more clearly. Let's define each level as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then L2 = 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>Then L3 = 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L9, which is the outermost expression, multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*L8, and so on. So, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that approach. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 +1 =7, write down 7 <nEwLiNe>- 5*3 =15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8 <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27, write down 27 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems a bit off.

Okay, so I have this math problem to solve:  <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses.

Maybe if I start from the innermost part and calculate each layer one by one, I can avoid getting lost in the complexity. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression structure to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, counting the number <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, no.

Then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, and so on, until Layer9 is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should represent this as a sequence where each term is defined based on the next one. <nEwLiNe>Let me define: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each layer starting from the innermost as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say: <nEwLiNe>- Let a₁ = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ <nEwLiNe>- a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ <nEwLiNe>- ... <nEwLiNe>- And so on, up to a₉, and the entire expression is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute a₁ through a₉ step by step, I can find the value. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each a_i step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a₁: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next, a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*a₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*a₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*a₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*a₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that again: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing a₉.

Because each a_i seems to be following a specific recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Indeed, the recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, starting from a₁. <nEwLiNe>But wait, actually, starting from the innermost, which is a₁ = 1 + 3, then a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁, and so on. So, it's a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me think about it. Since each a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, but actually, it's more like a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, which is a bit non-standard because it's forward recursive. <nEwLiNe>Wait, usually, we have recurrence relations like a_{n} = something with a_{n-1}. But here, each term is defined in terms of the next term. That complicates things a bit. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps we can reverse the order. Let me denote b_k = a_{10 - k}, so that b_1 = a_9, b_2 = a_8, ..., b_9 = a₁. <nEwLiNe>Then the recurrence becomes b_{k} = 1 + 3*b_{k-1}, with b_1 = a₉ = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But that might not necessarily help. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can express this recurrence as a linear equation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the recurrence is a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}. <nEwLiNe>But it's a bit tricky because each term depends on the next term. So, perhaps we can write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_{n+1} = (a_n - 1)/3. <nEwLiNe>But since we are computing from the innermost term outward, we can express each term as a function of the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to write out the terms: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*a₄ = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*a₅ = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*a₆ = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*a₇ = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈ = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, as we can see, each a_{n} is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a₁=4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from a₁=4, but a₂ is 1 + 3*a₁, which is 1 + 12=13, as above. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if we consider a₁=4, then a₂=1 + 3*a₁=13, a₃=1 + 3*a₂=40, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a₁=4. <nEwLiNe>But then, that's a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear function. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recall: for a recurrence of the form a_n = c*a_{n-1} + d, the solution is a_n = A*c^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>In this case, c=3, d=1. <nEwLiNe>So, the solution would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>To find A and B, we can plug in the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, so the homogeneous solution is 3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Let me set up the equation: <nEwLiNe>Assume a_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>Then, plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, left side: A*3^{n} + B <nEwLiNe>Right side: A*3^{n} + 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>Set them equal: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = A*3^{n} + 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 3B + 1 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3B: <nEwLiNe>-2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Wait, our initial condition is a₁=4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: <nEwLiNe>a₁ = A*3^{1} - 1/2 = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1, a₁=(3^{2} -1)/2=(9 -1)/2=8/2=4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=2, a₂=(3^{3} -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13, which also matches. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in general, a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for a₉, which is the 9th term, n=9: <nEwLiNe>a₉ = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a₉=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a₉=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, multiply 29524 by 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524 + 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me add 29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>4 + 4 = 8 <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>5 + 5 = 10, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9 + 9 +1=19, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 + 2 +1=5 <nEwLiNe>So, 59048. <nEwLiNe>Then add another 29524: <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524: <nEwLiNe>8 + 4=12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>4 + 2 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>0 +5=5 <nEwLiNe>9 +9=18, write 8, carryover1 <nEwLiNe>5 +2 +1=8 <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, verified each layer, used the recurrence relation, found a closed-form formula, and even double-checked the multiplication. So, I feel confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this math problem here that looks pretty involved with a bunch of nested parentheses. It goes like this: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that's quite a chain of operations. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built using a series of nested 3 times something, where each something is 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It looks recursive, almost like a fractal or something. So maybe I can tackle this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That seems like a solid strategy because each nested part depends on the one inside it. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no. Wait, actually, looking back, the structure is different. Each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n+1). So maybe I should define it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work from the inside out, computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Hmm, maybe I should represent each step as follows. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as E1, E2, up to E9, where E1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>E1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2: 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3: 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4: 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5: 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6: 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7: 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8: 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9: 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>E1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2: 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3: 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm multiplying 3 by one more than the previous result. So each En = 3*(1 + En+1). So starting from E1 = 4, each subsequent En is 3*(1 + previous En). <nEwLiNe>But let me verify E3, for example. E3 should be 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, E4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Yep. <nEwLiNe>E6: 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7: 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8: 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9: 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, if I follow this correctly, the outermost expression is E9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check by computing it step by step manually, just to ensure that I haven't missed any layers or made a multiplication mistake. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that I can use instead of computing each layer manually. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recursive structure: each En = 3*(1 + En+1). So, starting from E1 = 4, we can express each En in terms of En+1. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to model the recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let me define En = 3*(1 + En+1). Let's try to express this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can write En = 3 + 3*En+1. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for En. <nEwLiNe>Given that En = 3 + 3*En+1, and we know E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the recurrence is going in the opposite direction. Normally, we have En in terms of En-1, but here it's En in terms of En+1. Maybe I can reverse it. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's consider writing En+1 in terms of En. <nEwLiNe>From En = 3 + 3*En+1, we can rearrange: <nEwLiNe>En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>So, En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, but it's nonhomogeneous because of the constant term. Let me see if I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, write the homogeneous equation: En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, maybe it's better to express it as En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it as En+1 = (1/3)*En - 1. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation of the form En+1 = a*En + b, where a = 1/3 and b = -1. <nEwLiNe>The standard method for solving such recursions is to find the homogeneous solution and then find a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: En+1 = (1/3)*En. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r = 1/3, so the homogeneous solution is C*(1/3)^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (-1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say En = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: K = (1/3)*K - 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: K - (1/3)K = -1 => (2/3)K = -1 => K = -1*(3/2) = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is En = homogeneous + particular = C*(1/3)^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, we need to find the constant C using the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the initial condition is E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But in the general solution, En is expressed in terms of n. Let me check how the indexing works. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our recurrence, we have En+1 = (1/3)*En - 1. So, if we set n = 1, En = E1 = 4, then E2 = (1/3)*E1 - 1 = (1/3)*4 - 1 = 4/3 - 1 = 1/3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I computed E2 manually, I got E2 = 15, which contradicts this. Hmm, so perhaps my approach is flawed. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, I think I messed up the indexing. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>In my initial computation, E1 was the innermost layer, which is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then E2 is 3*(1 + E1) = 15, E3 is 3*(1 + E2) = 48, etc. <nEwLiNe>But in the recurrence relation, I tried to express En+1 in terms of En, but perhaps I misapplied the indices. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's redefine this properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider that each En is defined as 3*(1 + En+1), starting from E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 147. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to E9. <nEwLiNe>So, in terms of the recurrence, En = 3*(1 + En+1), with E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, it's En = 3 + 3*En+1. <nEwLiNe>To express this as En+1 in terms of En, we get En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from E1 = 4, we can compute E2, E3, etc., as we did before. <nEwLiNe>But if I try to model this as a recurrence relation, it might be tricky because the recursion goes forward, not backward. So, perhaps it's better to consider the reverse. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think of this as a geometric series when unwinding the recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to write out the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3 + 3*E1 = 3 + 12 = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3 + 3*E2 = 3 + 45 = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3 + 441 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3 + 1332 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3 + 4005 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3 + 12024 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3 + 36081 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems consistent with my earlier computation. So, each step, I'm adding 3 to three times the previous term. <nEwLiNe>But is there a pattern here? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers, I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. So, En = 3*En-1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my earlier definition, En = 3*(1 + En+1), which is 3 + 3*En+1, meaning that En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>So, En+1 = (En - 3)/3. <nEwLiNe>So, if I rearrange, En = 3*En+1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems a bit conflicting with the previous thought. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a recurrence relation where each term is defined in terms of the next term, which is a bit unusual. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a formula. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a sum. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to expand the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, I arrive at E9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me check my calculations once more to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Starting from E1: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so each step seems correct. Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely thorough, let me try to compute the entire expression in a different way, maybe by expanding the parentheses step by step without assigning E1 to E9. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out one layer, we have 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the same result as before. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series where each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 3 each time. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, it's more like each term is 3 + 3*previous term. <nEwLiNe>So, En = 3 + 3*En-1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our earlier computation, E2 = 3 + 3*E1 = 3 + 12 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, E3 = 3 + 3*E2 = 3 + 45 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, this recurrence relation is En = 3 + 3*En-1, with E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is of the form En = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Let me plug in the recurrence into the general solution. <nEwLiNe>En = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Then, En = 3 + 3*En-1. <nEwLiNe>Substituting the general solution into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B). <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right-hand side: <nEwLiNe>3 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B. <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 3 + A*3^n + 3B. <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 3 + 3B. <nEwLiNe>Rearranging: <nEwLiNe>B - 3B = 3 => -2B = 3 => B = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is En = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>E1 = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form expression is En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can write 3^n as 3^n, so: <nEwLiNe>En = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute E1 using this formula to verify: <nEwLiNe>E1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, E2 = (11/6)*3^2 - 3/2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = 49.5 - 1.5 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E4 = (11/6)*81 - 3/2 = (891/6) - 3/2 = 148.5 - 1.5 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E5 = (11/6)*243 - 3/2 = (2673/6) - 3/2 = 445.5 - 1.5 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E6 = (11/6)*729 - 3/2 = (8019/6) - 3/2 = 1336.5 - 1.5 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E7 = (11/6)*2187 - 3/2 = (24057/6) - 3/2 = 4009.5 - 1.5 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E8 = (11/6)*6561 - 3/2 = (72171/6) - 3/2 = 12028.5 - 1.5 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>E9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 = (216513/6) - 3/2 = 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form formula works perfectly, and we can use it to compute E9 directly without computing each intermediate step. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 divided by 6 is 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11. <nEwLiNe>Let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080. <nEwLiNe>0.5 * 11 = 5.5. <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, E9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure that I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify E9 using the closed-form formula: <nEwLiNe>E9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>So, (11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 19683 / 6 = 3280.5. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080 and 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3/2 = 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute it as: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*19683 = (11 * 19683)/6. <nEwLiNe>11 * 19683: Let's compute 10*19683 = 196830, plus 1*19683 = 19683, total = 196830 + 19683 = 216513. <nEwLiNe>Then, 216513 / 6 = 36085.5. <nEwLiNe>Subtract 1.5: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the computed value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think I've double-checked it thoroughly, both by step-by-step computation and by deriving a closed-form formula, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 3 to the result. After computing each layer step by step, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
