Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.

Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. It seems like a recursive structure where each layer depends on the previous one. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That makes sense because each inner expression is part of the next outer expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost part, which is the last (1 + 3). Let me compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me label each layer for clarity. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on until Layer 9, since there are nine layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, counting from the innermost, it's 9 layers. Let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, it's (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...) outside. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3(1 + that) <nEwLiNe>3. Then another 3(1 + that) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first ""3"". <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" corresponds to a new layer. Let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, the original expression is 3(...), and inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me count how many times 3( appears: <nEwLiNe>- Starting from the first 3( after the initial 3(...), it's 9 times. Wait, maybe I should count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) terms. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) So, from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3(...), and each is multiplied by 3. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me start computing from the innermost parentheses and move outward. <nEwLiNe>So, innermost is (1 + 3). Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> So Layer 2 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that again to make sure I didn't make any multiplication errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step, I'm adding 1 to the previous layer's result and multiplying by 3. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer).  <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute a couple of layers again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So 300+120=420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Let's compute 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>12000*3=36000 <nEwLiNe>28*3=84 <nEwLiNe>So, 36000 + 84 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result of the entire expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I don't think I made any calculation errors this time, so I'm confident with this answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied together. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to tackle this. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out, right? That makes sense because each expression depends on the one inside it. So, I should probably start solving from the innermost part and keep expanding each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression step by step to visualize it better. The innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Then, moving out, each subsequent expression is \(1 + 3(\text{previous expression})\). So, if I can compute each of these step by step, it should help. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with the innermost parentheses: \(1 + 3\). That should be easy. \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. The next layer out is \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 1})\). So, substituting the value from step 1: \(1 + 3(4)\). Let's compute that. \(3 \times 4 = 12\), so \(1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 2})\). So, that's \(1 + 3(13)\). Calculating \(3 \times 13 = 39\), then \(1 + 39 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>4. Moving out another layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 3})\). Which is \(1 + 3(40)\). That's \(3 \times 40 = 120\), so \(1 + 120 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next, \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 4})\). So, \(1 + 3(121)\). Calculating \(3 \times 121 = 363\), then \(1 + 363 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 5})\). That is \(1 + 3(364)\). Let me compute \(3 \times 364\). Hmm, 364 times 3. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, \(1 + 1092 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next, \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 6})\). So, \(1 + 3(1093)\). Calculating \(3 \times 1093\). Hmm, 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, and 3 times 3 is 9. Adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, \(1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Moving out another layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 7})\). That's \(1 + 3(3280)\). Calculating \(3 \times 3280\). Let's break it down: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 200 times 3 is 600, 80 times 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, \(1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next, \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 8})\). So, \(1 + 3(9841)\). Calcul <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Actually, looking back, the structure is each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, perhaps it's better to compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I misapplied the layers earlier. Let me re-express the entire problem step by step. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364. Let me compute 3*364 again. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900+180=1080+12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000+270=3270+9=3279. 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. 9000+600=9600+240=9840. 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding up: 27000+2400=29400+120=29520+3=29523. Then, 1 + 29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*29524. So, 29524*3. Let me compute that again. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 + 1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 88572. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm with another method. Maybe adding 29524 three times. <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524 = 59048. <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524. Let's add: <nEwLiNe>59048 + 20000 = 79048 <nEwLiNe>79048 + 9000 = 88048 <nEwLiNe>88048 + 500 = 88548 <nEwLiNe>88548 + 24 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's the same result. So, 3*29524 is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and I double-checked the multiplication at the end. So, I feel confident that the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. I need to figure out how to approach this. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression to see it better. It seems like each part is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). There are nine sets of parentheses here, so it's like a chain of 3 times (1 + ...). Hmm, maybe I can compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3 multiplied by that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * (1 + 3) = 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, moving out: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Then, 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Then, 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Then, 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Then, 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Then, 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Then, 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that again. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, so I should have nine layers of operations. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems like 18 steps, but the original expression only has nine layers. Maybe I'm confusing the number of operations with the number of layers. Let me visualize the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(1 + ... parts, I <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, wait, no, actually, in the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, Layer 2 would be 3*(1 + Layer 1). So, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: Then, moving outward, Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, that doesn't match my earlier computation. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first attempt, I thought Layer 1 was 1+3=4, then Layer 2 was 3*4=12, then Layer 3 was 1+12=13, etc. But now, I'm seeing that each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1). So, maybe my initial approach was incorrect because I alternated between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. Each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3)=4. Then, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + 4)=15. Then, moving another layer out, it's 3*(1 + 15)=48. Then, Layer 4 would be 3*(1 + 48)=147. Hmm, this seems different from my previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. Is each layer 3*(1 + previous result) or is it 1 + 3*(previous result)? Let me look back at the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by (1 plus 3 multiplied by ... )). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4)=15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2)=3*(1 + 15)=48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the final result would be 36084. But in my first approach, I ended up with 88572. That discrepancy is concerning. Maybe I need to figure out which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. In the first approach, I was adding 1 and multiplying alternately, but in the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me see which one aligns with the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, yes, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, my second approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial calculation was wrong because I alternated incorrectly. So, let me redo it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check this again because 36084 seems a bit low considering the number of layers. Let me verify each step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step checks out. So, the final result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first attempt, I had a different number, 88,572. That was because I was incorrectly alternating operations. I think the correct approach is to consider each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). So, the second method is accurate. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such expressions. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. Then, E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). But since the expression repeats itself, maybe I can express it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I let E = 3(1 + E'), where E' is the next layer. But actually, each layer is similar but not the same as E. Hmm, maybe not the best approach. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see the pattern from the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 36084 <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each term is 3*(previous term + 1). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute a few terms: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so this confirms the earlier calculation. Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way. Let's try expanding the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as E1: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, this is different from before. Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, E2 should be 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if I denote E2 as 1 + 3*E1, that would be incorrect because the structure is 3*(1 + E1), not 1 + 3*E1. So, I need to be careful with the order. <nEwLiNe>So, to avoid confusion, let me define each layer properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define E1 as the innermost expression: E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, it's 3*(1 + E1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Let's call this E2. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving another layer out, it's 3*(1 + E2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Let's call this E3. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way: <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + E3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + E4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + E5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + E6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + E7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + E8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, again, we get 36,084. This seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this as a recurrence relation and solve it mathematically. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let's try to find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This can be rewritten as: <nEwLiNe>a_n + c = 3*(a_{n-1} + c) <nEwLiNe>We can solve for c: <nEwLiNe>a_n + c = 3*a_{n-1} + 3c <nEwLiNe>Comparing coefficients: <nEwLiNe>Coefficient of a_n: 1 <nEwLiNe>Coefficient of a_{n-1}: 3 <nEwLiNe>Constant term: c = 3c => c = 0, which doesn't help. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me consider the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3A - 1.5 => 3A = 5.5 => A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute a_9 using this formula. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, divide 19683 by 6: 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is indeed 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I think this confirms that the correct answer is 36,084. My initial confusion was due to incorrectly alternating operations, but by carefully stepping through each layer and verifying with a mathematical approach, I arrived at the correct result. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward, each time calculating 3*(1 + previous result). This results in the final value of 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"

Alright, so I need to compute this expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that looks like a nested expression with a bunch of 1s and 3s. Let me see how to tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). Since it's nested multiple times, maybe I can compute it from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That makes sense because each inner expression is used in the outer one. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(...). Each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer.

Then again 1 + 3(...), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), so each layer is one less. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) inside: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(innermost) <nEwLiNe>Then, wrapping that: 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many times the 1 + 3(...) occurs: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>1.

Wait, but the innermost is 1 + 3, so maybe I need to be careful here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misread the structure. Let me parse the expression again carefully. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So starting from the outermost, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). The innermost is (1 + 3). So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then the next is 1 + 3*(result of previous), and so on, until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, each step is: current_layer = 1 + 3*(previous_layer). Starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer9). So: <nEwLiNe>Final result = 3*(Layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 3*300=900, 3*64=192, so 900+192=1092. Plus 1 is 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1000=3000, 3*93=279, so 3000+279=3279. Plus 1 is 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000+840=9840. Plus 1 is 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9000=27000, 3*841=2523. So 27000+2523=29523. Plus 1 is 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then the outermost is 3*29524. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000=60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000=27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500=1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24=72 <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, it's better to compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip any layers or make a miscalculation: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Outermost: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, and the calculations check out. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence where each term is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the sequence would be: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the result is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, this method also leads to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Another way to approach this is to recognize that this is a geometric series or to find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me consider that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = 27 -1=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a3=(3^4 -1)/2=81-1=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a9=(3^{10}-1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*a9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, we arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I didn't see the recurrence relation, I could have noticed that each layer is being multiplied by 3 and added 1 in a repetitive fashion, which is similar to a geometric series but with an additional constant term each time. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, since the multiplier is consistent (3 each time), the recurrence approach worked well. <nEwLiNe>Another approach might be to consider that each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*previous. So, as we computed step by step, each layer builds on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>It's important to note that since each layer is dependent on the previous one, we can't compute them independently; we have to work from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>I think I've verified it sufficiently through multiple methods: step-by-step computation, recognizing the recurrence relation, and solving it to find a closed-form formula. All methods lead to the same final result of 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s with a lot of multiplications and additions. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way out. That seems like a good plan. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down step by step. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me check. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses. So, I think I might have miscounted. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is the last one. So, yes, replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, the next parentheses is (1 + 3( ... )). So, let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, the expression after replacing the innermost part is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the next innermost is (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) Wait, no, actually, it's the next one. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should number the parentheses to make it clearer. <nEwLiNe>Let me assign numbers from the innermost to the outermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, the next level is: <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3( ... )) where ... is the result from step 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each parentheses is 1 + 3*(something). So, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, actually, this is a recursive kind of expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a series of operations where each step is 1 + 3*(next step). So, starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each level as follows: <nEwLiNe>Level 9: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 1) <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, maybe I should compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. <nEwLiNe>Let me correct that. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. That's right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Yes. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. That adds up. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Yes, that's accurate. <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. Let me double-check that multiplication. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7. <nEwLiNe>24 * 3 = 72, plus 7 is 79, write down 9, carry over 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, plus 7 is 22, write down 2, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, plus 2 is 29, write down 9, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 is 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's it. Each step builds on the previous one, and by carefully computing each layer, I arrived at the final answer. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down step by step made it manageable. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together. Let me see if I can break this down step by step. Maybe I'll start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually seems to work with these kinds of expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure. The expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (the innermost part)). So each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So maybe I should write each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from the inside out. Let's say the innermost is layer 1, then layer 2 wraps around that, and so on until layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. Hmm, actually, looking at the expression, I count nine sets of ""1 + 3(...)"", so yeah, nine layers. Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, total expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, I need to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), so: <nEwLiNe>3*(29524) = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>First, 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, digit 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, digit 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, digit 5, carryover 1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Each layer is actually (1 + 3*(previous layer)), right? So Layer 2 is (1 + 3*Layer 1). <nEwLiNe>So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Got it. So each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so Layer 9 is 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9), which is 3*29,524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29,524: <nEwLiNe>First, multiply 29,524 by 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now add them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the layers.

Let me recount them: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, all layers check out. So Layer 9 is indeed 29,524. Multiplying that by 3 gives 88,572. Hmm, that seems like a big number, but given the recursion, it makes sense. <nEwLiNe>Just to be thorough, let me see if there's a pattern or formula that could represent this recursion without computing each layer manually. Maybe a geometric series or something. <nEwLiNe>Looking at each layer, each one is defined as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, let's assume a constant particular solution a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: K = 1 + 3*K => K = 1 + 3K => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So for Layer 9, n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the answer. But just to make sure, let me see if I can compute this without going through each layer, using the formula. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 = 177147. <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Each layer is multiplying by 3 and adding 1, except the innermost one. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, the step-by-step computation and the formula both lead me to the same answer: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods confirm the result. So I feel confident that the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
8,36084,0,0,3905,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. It looks like a nested expression where each level adds 1 and multiplies by 3. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That sounds like a plan. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let me write down the expression step by step, starting from the innermost part. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3 multiplied by the result of the innermost parentheses. So, the next step is 3 * 4. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Second level: 3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out another level, we have 1 + 12. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>Third level: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Let me make sure I'm doing this right. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous result, right? So, actually, it's not 1 + (3 * previous), but rather 3*(1 + previous). Wait, no, hold on. Let me parse the expression again. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each level is 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Start with innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next level is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let me correct my earlier steps. So, maybe I messed up the order. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Next level: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems better. So, each time, I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, it's a recursive process. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step, numbering each level from the innermost to the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Level 1 (innermost): 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + Level1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + Level2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + Level3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + Level4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + Level5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + Level6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + Level7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + Level8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count how many levels there are. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Let me count the number of 3(1+3(...) terms. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(...), each subsequent 3(...) adds a level. So, starting from the innermost (1+3), that's the first level, then each <<INJECTED THINKING>> Got that. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, it seems like each layer is multiplying the result of the previous layer by 3 and then adding 3. Wait, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, each step is 3*(1 + previous). That makes sense because each time you have 3 multiplied by (1 plus the inner expression). <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each layer seems to be calculated correctly. So, the final result of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, just in case I missed a step or made an arithmetic error. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. So, the final answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a general formula for such expressions. Since each layer is 3*(1 + previous), it's similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>I can try to solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write down the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but our initial conditions are positive, so maybe this approach isn't the best. Alternatively, maybe I can express it as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me try expanding the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*a_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 9*a_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*a_{n-3}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*a_{n-3} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this, it seems like a_n = 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}) + 3^n*a_0 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but our initial term is a_1 = 4, not a_0. So, maybe adjust the indices. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's write the recurrence as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>As before, homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a particular solution of the form a_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*A = 3 <nEwLiNe>A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. Let's see, at n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2) <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that: <nEwLiNe>(11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=5: <nEwLiNe>a_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, for the 9th layer, n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 10*19683 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1*19683 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 11*19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Subtract 9: 216513 - 9 = 216504 <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36000 = 216000 <nEwLiNe>216504 - 216000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36000 + 84 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36084, which matches my earlier step-by-step calculation. So, that confirms that the result is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, thinking about it as a geometric series, each layer is 3 times the previous plus 3, so it's a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3. The formula I derived earlier is a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. Plugging in n=9 gives 36084, which is consistent. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, I can also compute it iteratively again: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result each time. So, I can be confident that 36084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about this is recognizing the pattern as a geometric sequence. Each term is 3 times the previous term plus 3. So, it's a linear recurrence, which I already solved, but just thinking about it as a geometric series helps reinforce the solution. <nEwLiNe>So, in summary, by working from the innermost parentheses outward and computing each layer step by step, I arrive at the final result of 36084. Additionally, using the recurrence relation method, I also arrived at the same result, which further confirms its correctness. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple methods all point to the same answer. So, I feel confident that 36084 is the correct value of the given expression. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, calculate 3 times 4, which is 12. Then, add 1: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>So, that middle layer simplifies to 13. Now, moving another layer out, we have 1 + 3(13). Let me do that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 13 is 39. Then, add 1: 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so that layer is 40. Next layer out is 1 + 3(40). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 times 40 is 120. Add 1: 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 121. Next layer: 1 + 3(121).  <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3 times 121: 363. Then add 1: 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>That's 364. Moving out another layer, we have 1 + 3(364). <nEwLiNe>3 times 364: Let me do that. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, 4 times 3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer is 1093. Next layer out: 1 + 3(1093). <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, 3 times 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>That's 3280. Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 280 times 3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 is 9840. Then add 1: 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, that layer simplifies to 9841. Next layer out: 1 + 3(9841). <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3 times 9841. 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, 1 times 3 is 3. So, adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 29524. Finally, the outermost layer is 1 + 3(29524). <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3 times 29524. Hmm, 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, 4 times 3 is 12. Wait, no, actually, 2 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I tried to compute it step by step, I ended up with 88572, but when I was recounting, I was at Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524, and then the outermost layer is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial thought process, I was computing each layer step by step and ended up with the same result: 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize, starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I thought I was getting 88572, but when I was recounting, I was getting confused because I was recounting each layer. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each layer checks out. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. Wait, but earlier I thought I had 88572, but when I was recounting, I was confused because I was recounting each layer. Let me see if I have any discrepancies. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in both cases, I got 88572. So, maybe I was just confusing myself earlier, but it seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about it. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for L_n. <nEwLiNe>The general form for such a recurrence is L_n = a*L_{n-1} + b. <nEwLiNe>In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. <nEwLiNe>The solution to such a recurrence is L_n = a^{n} * L_0 + b*(a^{n} - 1)/(a - 1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but our initial condition is L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's adjust the formula accordingly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can write this as L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume L_n^{(p)} = A, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying the initial condition L_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplifying, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer n, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So, n = 9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I was just confusing myself earlier when I was recounting, but both methods lead to the same result. It's reassuring to see that the closed-form formula gives the same answer as the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the key steps were: <nEwLiNe>1. Identify that each layer is a recurrence relation: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>2. Solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>3. Use the closed-form expression to compute the value at n=9. <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, computing each layer step by step also works, but the closed-form method is more efficient, especially if the number of layers is large. <nEwLiNe>In conclusion, the computed value of the given expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we can break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>1. **Identify the recurrence relation:** <nEwLiNe>   Each layer is of the form \(L_n = 1 + 3L_{n-1}\), starting from \(L_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. **Solve the recurrence relation:** <nEwLiNe>   The general solution is \(L_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>3. **Compute for \(n = 9\):** <nEwLiNe>   \(L_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>4. **Multiply by 3:** <nEwLiNe>   The entire expression is \(3 \times 29524 = 88572\). <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer:** \(\boxed{88572}\"
10,88572,1,7,3560,"
Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together in a recursive kind of way. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me make sure I'm reading it correctly. It's 1 + 3( ... ). So, the structure is 1 + 3*(something).  <nEwLiNe>So, the next level out is: 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that simplifies to 13. Now, moving out another level, the next expression is again 1 + 3 times the previous result. So: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 40. Let me keep track of these results: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this pattern, the next level would be: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that's 121. Moving out another layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Okay, 364. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Whoa, that's a big number. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 3280. Continuing: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Wow, 9841. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>And the next layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now we're getting into the higher layers. Let me recap all these steps to make sure I haven't missed anything: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, hold on. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)), so after computing the innermost 10 layers, we have 88573. But then we have an outermost 3 multiplied by that result. So, actually, the entire expression is 3 times the last number I computed, which is 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the final step is: 3 * 88573 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3 * 88,573 <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>First, 80,000 * 3 = 240,000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 <nEwLiNe>Next, 50 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, no, wait. Actually, the structure is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think I made a mistake there. Let me clarify. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4, Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, let me recompute that: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has an outermost 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, but I thought Layer 9 was 29524, so multiplying by 3 gives 88572. But earlier, when I was computing step by step, I ended up with 3*88573, which was 265,719. That seems inconsistent. Maybe I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again, more carefully. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count the number of layers: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing this, there are 9 layers in total inside the outermost 3. So, after computing all 9 layers, we get a number, and then we multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought the final result was 88573. That must have been a miscalculation. Let me verify Layer 9 again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 29524 is the result after 9 layers. Then, the outermost 3 multiplies this: <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the result was 88,573. Maybe I added an extra layer somewhere. Let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's 9 layers. So, the outermost multiplication by 3 is correct, giving 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 88573 before multiplying by 3, which led to 265,719. That must have been an error in counting the layers or misapplying the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute the expression again, perhaps more systematically. Let me write down each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, we have 29,524. Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29,524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, multiply 29,524 by 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x      3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought I had 88573, but that must have been a mistake. It's important to carefully recount each step to avoid errors, especially with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 1 + 3*a_p <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: <nEwLiNe>a_p - 3*a_p = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*a_p = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_p = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplifying, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But in our case, we have 9 layers, starting from a_1 = 4 up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, our innermost layer is a_1 = 4, which corresponds to n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10} = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using both the step-by-step method and the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the computed value is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) It looks pretty nested with all those 1s and 3s. Hmm, I need to figure out a way to simplify this without getting lost in the parentheses. Maybe I can work from the innermost part and move outward step by step. Let me write it down more clearly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parenthesis: (1 + 3). That's straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so now the innermost part is 4. Let me compute the next layer. The next one out is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute 3(4) first: 3*4 is 12. Then, 1 + 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Moving up, the next layer is 1 + 3(13). 3*13 is 39. 1 + 39 is 40. So replacing that: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(40). 3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 is 121. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) <nEwLiNe>Moving up, 1 + 3(121). 3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 is 364. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(364). 3*364 is 1092. 1 + 1092 is 1093. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))) <nEwLiNe>Now, 1 + 3(1093). 3*1093 is 3279. 1 + 3279 is 3280. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)) <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280 is 9840. 1 + 9840 is 9841. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841)) <nEwLiNe>Moving up, 1 + 3(9841). 3*9841 is 29523. 1 + 29523 is 29524. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 29524) <nEwLiNe>Finally, 1 + 29524 is 29525. Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29525. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29525: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*25 is 75. So adding those together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 75 = 88575. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88575. Let me just verify my steps quickly to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe> <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, maybe I misapplied that. Let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*Layer 1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*Layer 2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*Layer 3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*Layer 4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*Layer 5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*Layer 6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*Layer 7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*Layer 8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, there's an outermost multiplication by 3. So, after Layer 9, the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, the final computation would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, but earlier I thought the answer was 88575. There's a discrepancy here. Let me check where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at Layer 1 through Layer 9: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3: 3*29524 = 88572. So, why did I think it was 88575 earlier? Maybe I added wrong somewhere in my initial calculation. Let me recalculate 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: <nEwLiNe>First, break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>= (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24) * 3 <nEwLiNe>= 20000*3 + 9000*3 + 500*3 + 24*3 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 + 1500 + 72 <nEwLiNe>= 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so it's definitely 88572, not 88575. I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation when I thought it was 88575. So, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, in my first approach, I had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) and ended up with 88575, but in the second, more careful step-by-step, I got 88572. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me recount the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the second method is correct, and the first one had an error somewhere. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the problem statement, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. So, in my second approach, I did nine layers correctly, ending up with 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. That seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, I thought the answer was 88575, which is 3 more than 88572. Hmm, maybe I added 1 incorrectly somewhere. Let me check each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. So, I must have made an addition error in my initial calculation when I thought it was 88575. Maybe I added 29524 + 29524 + 29524 incorrectly. <nEwLiNe>Let me try adding 29524 three times: <nEwLiNe>29524 + 29524 = 59048 <nEwLiNe>59048 + 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of layers to make sure. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Yes, each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer, so 9 layers in total. So, my step-by-step is correct, leading to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the first method, I ended up with 88575, which is 3 more. Let me see where that could have happened. Maybe I miscalculated 3*29524 as 88575 instead of 88572. Let me compute 29524*3 again: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 88572. So, correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, in the problem statement, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of 1+3 terms. Starting from the innermost, there are 9 instances of (1 + 3). So, 9 layers. So, yes, my step-by-step is correct, 9 layers leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I think my initial mistake was probably a miscalculation when I did it the first time, but upon careful step-by-step, it's 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, to be absolutely sure, maybe I can write a small program or use another method to compute it. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize the pattern here. Each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each layer again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, my initial answer of 88575 was wrong due to a miscalculation, but upon careful step-by-step, it's 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually seems to help with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's break it down. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Hmm, I need to compute 3(4) first, right? <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Substituting back, the expression is now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Moving on to the next layer: 1 + 3(13). Again, compute 3*13 first. <nEwLiNe>3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Substituting, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))) <nEwLiNe>Next up: 1 + 3(40). Compute 3*40. <nEwLiNe>3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) <nEwLiNe>Continuing this process: 1 + 3(121). Compute 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Substituting, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(364). Compute 3*364. <nEwLiNe>3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>So, now the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))) <nEwLiNe>Moving in: 1 + 3(1093). Compute 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Substituting back, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280)) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). Compute 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>So, now the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841)) <nEwLiNe>Moving in: 1 + 3(9841). Compute 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Substituting back, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(29524) <nEwLiNe>Now, compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524: Let me compute that step by step. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 8 <<INJECTED THINKING>> So Layer 2 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So actually, starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36084. But wait, let me verify that because I might have miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's different from my previous result. I think I messed up the layer numbering earlier. Let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Each time, we're computing 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, it seems my initial approach was incorrect because I misapplied the layers. The correct way is to compute each subsequent layer by multiplying by 3 and adding 1, starting from the innermost.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those nested parentheses. I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. Let me write it down and see if I can break it down from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with 1 + 3(...).

Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of layers. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>It seems like there are 9 layers here because the original expression has 9 sets of parentheses. Wait, let me check again. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Each opening parenthesis adds another layer, and the innermost is 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way until we reach the outermost layer, which is multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, I think there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...) before the outermost 3 is multiplied. Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Each time, inside the parentheses, it's 1 + 3*(...). The innermost is 1 + 3. Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the 9th layer, right? So after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, we multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, adding all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 8 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. The expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, let me compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000 * 3 = 60000, <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000, <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500, <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60, <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000, <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500, <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560, <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we can simplify it step by step by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working our way outward. <nEwLiNe>1. **Innermost Layer (Layer 1):** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. **Layer 2:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. **Layer 3:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>4. **Layer 4:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>5. **Layer 5:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>6. **Layer 6:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>7. **Layer 7:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>8. **Layer 8:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>9. **Layer 9:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply the result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I've got this math problem here: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Man, that's a mouthful! It's like a Russian doll of parentheses. Okay, but I can handle this. Let's see... I think the best way to tackle something like this is to start from the inside and work my way out. That usually makes things clearer. <nEwLiNe>So, first off, I'll look for the innermost parentheses. In this case, it's the last part: (1 + 3). That seems simple enough. 1 plus 3 is 4. Cool, so I can replace that innermost part with 4. Now the expression looks like: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). Hmm, still complicated, but at least that first step is done. <nEwLiNe>Next, I need to figure out what the next layer out is. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, after replacing the innermost parentheses, the next one would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me calculate that: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Okay, so now I can replace that part with 13. The expression is now: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))\). Getting somewhere! <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving outward, the next layer is 1 + 3*(13). Let's do that: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40)))))))))\). Nice, progress! <nEwLiNe>Continuing this pattern, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). Calculating that: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. So, updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))))))\). Good. <nEwLiNe>Next up: 1 + 3*(121). Let's see: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Updating the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))))\). Moving on. <nEwLiNe>Now, the layer is 1 + 3*(364). Calculating: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. So, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))))\). Almost there! <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093). Let's compute that: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280.

14,88572,1,6,2209,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1 inside another set of parentheses. It seems like a recursive structure where each layer is similar but one step deeper. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That sounds like a good plan. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the very inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so that innermost parentheses simplifies to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result plus 1. Wait, no, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3 times the next layer. So, actually, each time, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So maybe I should represent this as a sequence of terms. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as a term. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote: <nEwLiNe>- \( a_1 = 1 + 3 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 \) <nEwLiNe>- \( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 \) <nEwLiNe>- Finally, the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). So actually, each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3, then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, etc., up to a_9, and then the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, let me write that down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \) <nEwLiNe>2. \( a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \) <nEwLiNe>3. \( a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \) <nEwLiNe>4. \( a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \) <nEwLiNe>5. \( a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \) <nEwLiNe>6. \( a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \) <nEwLiNe>7. \( a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \) <nEwLiNe>8. \( a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \) <nEwLiNe>9. \( a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \) <nEwLiNe>Okay, so \( a_9 = 29524 \). Then, the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \), so: <nEwLiNe>Total = 3 * 29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carry <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).

That's correct. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

Correct. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3 = (20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>Compute each part: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors, especially in the multiplication steps. <nEwLiNe>Starting from a1 to a9: <nEwLiNe>a1: 4 <nEwLiNe>a2: 13 <nEwLiNe>a3: 40 <nEwLiNe>a4: 121 <nEwLiNe>a5: 364 <nEwLiNe>a6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Each step seems to be correct, multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying a9 by 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 (carryover) = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 (carryover) = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 (carryover) = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from top to bottom: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches my previous result. <nEwLiNe>So, I'm confident that the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. First, 3 times 4 is 12, right? So 1 + 12 is 13. So now, replacing that, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3(13). Hmm, 3 times 13 is 39, and 1 + 39 is 40. So replacing that, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) <nEwLiNe>Moving another layer out: 1 + 3(40). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121))))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(121). 3 times 121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(364). 3 times 364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. So now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(1093). 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. So now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(3280). 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. So now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841)) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3(9841). 3 times 9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. So now: <nEwLiNe>3(29524) <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3 times 29524. Let me compute that. 29524 times 3. Hmm, let me do it step by step. 29524 times 3: 20000 times 3 is 60000, 9000 times 3 is 27000, 500 times 3 is 1500, 20 times 3 is 60, and 4 times 3 is 12. Adding all together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that multiplication again because that seems a bit high. Maybe I should compute it more carefully: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>x    3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute each digit: <nEwLiNe>4 x 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 x 3 = 6, plus 1 is 7. <nEwLiNe>5 x 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Actually, looking back, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). So, Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 13) = 3*14 = 42. Wait, no, again, it's 1 + 3*(Layer 2). So, Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the final result is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the numbers from top to bottom: 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me verify my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. Let me go through each layer again. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Yep. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Yes. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Right. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88572. Let me check that multiplication again. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that gives us 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. I don't see any errors in my steps. It's a bit tedious with so many layers, but breaking it down one by one made it manageable. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I wonder if there's a pattern or formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is following a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 4, and a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. Maybe I can find a general formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that. Since it's a linear recurrence relation, perhaps I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, in our original problem, how many layers do we have? Let me count the number of times the expression is nested. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer, and there are 9 such layers, starting from the innermost. So, the outermost operation is layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, when I numbered them earlier, Layer 1 was the innermost, and Layer 9 was the outermost before the final multiplication by 3. So, in terms of the formula, a_9 would be (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572, which matches my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>So, this formula confirms that the result is indeed 88572. It's a much quicker way instead of computing each layer step by step, especially if the number of layers is large. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, since it's only 9 layers, both methods work. It's good to know the formula for future reference. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the computed value is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That's a lot of nested parentheses! I need to figure out how to evaluate this step by step. Let me see... Since there are multiple layers of parentheses, I should probably start from the innermost one and work my way outwards. That makes sense because parentheses indicate that the operations inside should be done first. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, counting the number of 3s... Let me see: each time, it's 3 multiplied by a term that starts with 1 plus another 3 times something. It looks like it's a recursive-like structure, but maybe I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down. Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>Innermost expression: 1 + 3. That's simple enough. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: 3*4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(result of the inner layer). So, maybe each time I can compute the next layer by plugging in the result from the previous step. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Let's define each layer step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Layer 10: 1 + 3*(Layer 9) = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me count the layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let me check: starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3(...). So, the innermost is 1+3, then each outer layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is part of the next layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to how many? Let me see: starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each outer layer adds another 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, no. Wait, actually, each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1). So, perhaps I misapplied that earlier. Let me correct myself. <nEwLiNe>If Layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. Then Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on. So, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the previous layer's result. <nEwLiNe>So, starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, after computing Layer 9, which is 29524, I have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that again. Because sometimes when I break down multiplication, I might make a mistake. Let me compute 29524 * 3 directly. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. To be thorough, maybe I can compute it another way or check for a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with the earlier layers. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 =26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the closed-form formula works. Therefore, a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms my earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that looks like a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. It's like a chain of operations. So maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it might be manageable.

So starting from the innermost, which is \(1 + 3\), which is \(a_1\), then the next layer is \(1 + 3a_1 = a_2\), and so on until \(a_9\). Then, the entire expression is 3 times \(a_9\). Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute each \(a_i\) step by step, starting from \(a_1\) up to \(a_9\), then multiply the last one by 3, I should get the result. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Then, \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next, \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. Then, \(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. \(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. \(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. \(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. \(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. \(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is \(3a_9\), so: <nEwLiNe>Result = \(3 * 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>×     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on. Is that right? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Actually, each Layer n is (1 + 3*Layer(n-1)). So starting from Layer 1, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1. <nEwLiNe>So Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>×     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Let me compute each digit: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>×     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, carryover 1, write 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1, write 5 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2, write 8 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8 <nEwLiNe>So yes, it's 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify the layers again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each layer is just 1 plus three times the previous layer. So Layer 9 is 29,524. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, just to be thorough, maybe I can compute a couple of layers manually to check. <nEwLiNe>For example, Layer 1 is 4, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*4 = 13. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. So I think that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me just compute 29,524 * 3 another way. Maybe breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3 = (20,000 + 9,000 + 500 + 20 + 4) * 3 <nEwLiNe>= 20,000*3 + 9,000*3 + 500*3 + 20*3 + 4*3 <nEwLiNe>= 60,000 + 27,000 + 1,500 + 60 + 12 <nEwLiNe>= 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. So that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how to tackle this. It looks like each layer is similar, so maybe I can work from the inside out.  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4.  <nEwLiNe>So, replacing the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is 4, so the next layer is 1 + 3*(that result). So maybe I should write each step as I go outward. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's count the number of layers. Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer, and it seems there are 9 such layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>3. And this repeats. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of times ""1 + 3("" occurs. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers. So starting from the innermost, I need to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*109 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, wait, no. Actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me write it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Layer 2. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Layer 3. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Layer 4. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Layer 5. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Layer 6. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Layer 7. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Layer 8. <nEwLiNe>9. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 = 29523. Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check my calculations because the numbers are getting large quickly, and I want to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9, so total is 3000+270+9=3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840, so total is 9000+840=9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*9841. Let's compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step computation, the final result is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify with another approach to make sure. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, this expression is a nested multiplication that can be represented recursively. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from the innermost, each step is 1 + 3*(result from the previous step). After computing up to Layer 8, which is 9841, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Maybe it's a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if we denote L_n as the value at layer n, then L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Given that L_1 = 4, let's try to find A and B. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: L_1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A + B = 4. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. So, L_2 = 3A*3 + B = 9A + B = 13. <nEwLiNe>Now, we have two equations: <nEwLiNe>1. 3A + B = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 9A + B = 13 <nEwLiNe>Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 6A = 9 => A = 9/6 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Then, plugging back into equation 1: 3*(3/2) + B = 4 => 9/2 + B = 4 => B = 4 - 9/2 = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check for n=1: (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 - 1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for Layer 8, which is the innermost layer before the final multiplication by 3, n=8: <nEwLiNe>L_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, L_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*L_8 = 3*9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>I think this confirms the result. Both the step-by-step computation and the general formula lead to the same answer, so I'm confident that 29,523 is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{29523}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s all multiplied together in a chain. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to see how many layers there are. It seems like each layer is of the form 3(1 + something). Counting them... Hmm, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), there are nine sets of parentheses. So, nine layers to work through. That seems manageable if I take it one step at a time. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer separately, starting from the innermost one: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + result from step 2 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3(result from step 3) <nEwLiNe>5. Then: 1 + result from step 4 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3(result from step 5) <nEwLiNe>7. Then: 1 + result from step 6 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3(result from step 7) <nEwLiNe>9. Then: 1 + result from step 8 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3(result from step 9) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, each layer is 1 + 3(something). So, it's not just nine steps, but each step involves adding 1 and multiplying by 3. Maybe I should think of it as a recursive process where each term is built upon the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to define each step as a term, starting from the innermost. Let's denote each term as T1, T2, T3, up to T9, where each T is defined as Tn = 1 + 3*Tn-1, with T1 being the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, the innermost is just 1 + 3, so maybe T1 = 1 + 3. Then the next layer is 3*(T1), then 1 + that result, then multiply by 3, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to correct that. Let me parse the expression carefully. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then, moving outward, each time it's 3*(1 + previous result). Let me try to model this. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each step as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote: <nEwLiNe>- Starting from the innermost: A1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then moving outward: A2 = 3*(1 + A1) <nEwLiNe>- Then A3 = 3*(1 + A2) <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until A9 = 3*(1 + A8) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, maybe the innermost is A1 = 1 + 3, then A2 = 3*(1 + A1), A3 = 3*(1 + A2), and so on, until A9, which is the outermost expression. <nEwLiNe>But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(something). So, perhaps the number of terms is nine, each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to count the number of multiplications by 3. Starting from the innermost, each step is multiplied by 3. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*13 <<INJECTED THINKING>> So, Layer 2 is 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after computing each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, the final result is 36084. Hmm, that seems pretty big, but each step involved multiplying by 3 and adding 1, which grows the number quickly. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes along the way. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, each step checks out. It seems that each layer is 3*(1 + previous result), and this recursive computation leads to 36084 as the final answer. <nEwLiNe>I wonder if there's a pattern or a formula that can compute this without going through each layer step by step. Let me think about it. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as a recurrence where each term is defined based on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote T(n) as the value of the nth layer. Then, the recurrence relation would be: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = 3*(1 + T(n-1)) <nEwLiNe>With T(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me see if I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write down the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = 3*T(n-1) + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, T(n) = 3*(1 + T(n-1)) = 3 + 3*T(n-1). <nEwLiNe>So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation of the first order. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is T(n) = 3*T(n-1), which has the solution T_h(n) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say T_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*A = 3 <nEwLiNe>A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition T(1) = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Adding 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 <nEwLiNe>C = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>T(n) = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, the value should be: <nEwLiNe>T(9) = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3^9 first: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Now, plug into T(9): <nEwLiNe>T(9) = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683 = (10 + 1)*19683 = 10*19683 + 1*19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: <nEwLiNe>216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: <nEwLiNe>216,504 / 6 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, T(9) = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>That matches the result I got earlier by computing each layer step by step. So, that's reassuring. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me recount the layers to ensure I didn't miss any. The original expression has nine layers of parentheses, each starting with 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost (Layer 1) up to Layer 9. Since I computed up to Layer 9 and got 36,084, which matches the closed-form solution, I feel confident that this is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern as a geometric progression. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding a certain term, which can lead to a geometric series when expanded. However, given that the recurrence relation approach worked well and gave me the correct result, I think that's sufficient. <nEwLiNe>In conclusion, by either iteratively computing each layer or by finding a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, the result of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by iteratively evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Starting with the innermost expression (1 + 3), each subsequent layer is calculated by multiplying the result by 3 and adding 1. This process is repeated for each of the nine layers, leading to the final result of 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Explanation:** <nEwLiNe>1. **Identify the Innermost Expression:** <nEwLiNe>   - The innermost part is (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. **Compute Each Subsequent Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 2:** 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 3:** 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 4:** 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 5:** 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 6:** 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 7:** 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 8:** 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>   - **Layer 9:** 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>3. **Final Result:** <nEwLiNe>   - After computing all nine layers, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:**   <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}."

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a whole bunch of nested parentheses. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's quite a few layers. Let me see how I can tackle this. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that it's a series of nested expressions where each one is 1 plus 3 times something. That something is another similar expression. So, it seems like a recursive structure. Maybe I can work from the inside out? Yeah, that makes sense because the innermost part will give me a starting point, and I can build my way up. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression step by step. Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). That's easy: 1 + 3 equals 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(...)). So, replacing the inner part with 4, it becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer out is (1 + 3*(previous result)). The previous result was 13, so 3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 is 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Moving another layer out: (1 + 3*40). 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: (1 + 3*121). 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Then: (1 + 3*364). Let me calculate that. 3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: (1 + 3*1093). 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Then: (1 + 3*3280). 3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: (1 + 3*9841). Hmm, 3*9841. Let me compute that. 9841*3: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: (1 + 3*29524). Let me calculate 3*29524. 29524*3: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Now, remember that the entire expression is multiplied by 3. So, I have to compute 3 times that result. So, 3*88573. Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>88573*3: 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those together: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 26 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, no, hold on. Let me check that again. If Layer 1 is 4, then Layer 2 should be 1 + 3*Layer 1, which is 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think I confused the structure. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So, actually, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1), which is 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer 3 would be 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, so I need to compute each layer step by step, starting from Layer 1 up to Layer 9, and then multiply the outermost result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer's computation: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the result of the innermost parentheses working out to Layer 9 is 29524. But remember, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So, I need to compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me calculate that: <nEwLiNe>3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>3*20000 = 60000, <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000, <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500, <nEwLiNe>3*20 = 60, <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them all up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000, <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500, <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560, <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27, write down 7, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it all together: 88572. Yep, that matches. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me verify a couple of them. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>And finally, 3*29524 = 88572. All steps check out. I think I did this correctly. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure, maybe I can compute a smaller version of this problem to see if the method works. Let's say, compute 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's see what that would be. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*40 = 120. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, computing directly: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the method works for a smaller version. That gives me confidence that my approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result of the original expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"
