Prompt: Compute $3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))$
Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside:
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.
Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.
Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.
Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.
Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.
Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.
Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.

Okay, so I've got this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) . Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s with a lot of multiplications and additions. I need to figure out how to tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). Since it's nested so many times, I think the best approach is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can simplify each layer one at a time without getting lost in the complexity. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the left, the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times something). Each time, inside the parentheses, there's another 1 + 3 times something. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost part is (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving out, it's (1 + 3*(previous result)) <nEwLiNe>- This pattern continues until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of times this happens. Let me write down the structure: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, it seems like there are 9 layers of 3(1 + 3(...)) and the innermost is just 1 + 3. So, starting from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L9 is the innermost and L1 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outwards, <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*(L9) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Is it 3*(L8)? Because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, yes, each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the result of the next layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let me formalize this. <nEwLiNe>Starting from L9: <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*L9 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*(...), right? So, the outermost layer is 3 times the result of L1. <nEwLiNe>So, final result is 3 * L1 = 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that might not be the best way. Maybe just straight multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Compute each digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3 <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 60 = 88,560; 88,560 +12=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that's a lot of steps, and it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see a pattern or find a formula for this kind of expression to verify. <nEwLiNe>This expression is a form of a nested multiplication, which is similar to a geometric series but with a specific structure. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I denote each layer as a_n, then a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, starting from the innermost, which is a_9 = 4, then a_8 = 1 + 3*a_9, and so on. <nEwLiNe>But since we have 9 layers, starting from a_9 = 4, then a_8, a_7,... up to a_1. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, for n from 1 to 8, with a_9 =4. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps it's easier to think recursively or find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n+1}, with a_9=4. <nEwLiNe>But this is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's think about solving it. <nEwLiNe>But since it's only 9 layers, maybe it's faster to compute each step as I did before. <nEwLiNe>But just to see, perhaps we can solve the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the layers starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where a_1 = 4 (innermost), and then a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n >1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, the innermost is a_1 =4, then a_2 = 1 +3*a_1, a_3=1 +3*a <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...), so is Layer 9 the outermost? Hmm, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each time, the coefficient is 3, and inside is 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, perhaps I should define it differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 is 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 is 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 is 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 is 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 is 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, let me compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier I thought Layer 1 was 4, and then Layer 2 was 13, and so on, which is correct because each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, after computing up to Layer 9, which is 29524, and then multiplying by 3, I get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors, let me verify a couple of the layers. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Multiplying by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all steps check out. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series or find a formula to compute it without calculating each layer. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 9 layers, so the outermost layer is a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me confirm the indexing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when I defined a_1 as the innermost layer, which is 4, then a_2 is the next layer, which is 13, and so on up to a_9, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 =40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 =242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = (3^6 -1)/2 = (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = (3^7 -1)/2=(2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = (3^8 -1)/2=(6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = (3^9 -1)/2=(19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works perfectly. Therefore, a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 =3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, using both methods—step-by-step computation and solving the recurrence relation—we arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure there's no mistake in the formula, let me test it for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1=(3^{2}-1)/2=4, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2=13, correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81-1)/2=40, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems reliable. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3 times a bunch of nested parentheses. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of 3s and parentheses. Let me try to figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another term. It seems like a recursive structure, so maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That makes sense because each part depends on the result of the next one. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression in a more manageable way. Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the layer inside it. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Looking at the original expression: starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. I see that the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the first 3(...), each layer adds one more. So, the expression is 3 multiplied by a series of 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that again. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). Let's count the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers, since each layer adds another 3(...). So, starting from layer 1 to layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3(...) terms. The innermost is 1 + 3, then each next layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is 9 because after the innermost, each layer adds another 3(...). So, let's define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L_n, where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L_9, since the expression has 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, the outermost is 3*(L_9). So, the entire expression is 3*L_9. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, I need to compute L_1, then L_2, up to L_9, and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let me start computing each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Compute L_1 first: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so L_9 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>First, 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication step by step: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the units digit: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from L_1 to L_9: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to verify, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 + 29,524 + 29,524. <nEwLiNe>29,524 + 29,524 = 59,048 <nEwLiNe>59,048 + 29,524: <nEwLiNe>59,048 + 20,000 = 79,048 <nEwLiNe>79,048 + 9,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is recognizing that each layer is following a pattern similar to a geometric series, but since each term is 1 + 3*previous term, it's actually a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>But since the number of layers is manageable (only 9 layers), computing each step is feasible. <nEwLiNe>Wait <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, hold on, that's different from what I got before. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, now I'm confused because earlier I computed L_9 as 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572, but now, when I labeled it as layers where each layer is 3*(1 + previous), starting from Layer 1 as 4, then Layer 2 as 15, and so on, I ended up with Layer 9 as 36,084. Which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Hmm, there must be a mistake in my approach. Let me re-examine. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(...), and the innermost is (1 + 3). So, perhaps I need to consider that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define L_n as the value of the nth layer from the inside. <nEwLiNe>So, L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so earlier, when I was computing each layer as 3*(1 + previous), that was incorrect because actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), not 3*(1 + previous layer). So, that was my mistake. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct approach is: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(result of the layer inside). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the initial approach was correct, and the second approach where I was multiplying by 3 first was wrong because I misapplied the order of operations. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify again: <nEwLiNe>Compute each layer from the inside out: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*L_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*L_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 1 + 3*L_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 1 + 3*L_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 1 + 3*L_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 1 + 3*L_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 1 + 3*L_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*L_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the initial approach was correct, and the confusion came when I misapplied the order of operations in the second approach. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute L_9 again: <nEwLiNe>Starting from L_1: <nEwLiNe>L_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. I think I can confidently say that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize that each layer follows the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>But since this is a non-homogeneous recurrence, we can solve it as follows. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 1 <nEwLiNe>K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, <nEwLiNe>L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10} = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*L_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's another way to get the same result, confirming that the answer is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize, by computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form solution using recurrence relations, I arrived at the same result both ways. Therefore, I'm confident that 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
3,88572,1,15,4613,"
Okay, so I have this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 3s and 1s. It looks like a repeated pattern where each layer is of the form \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Maybe I can work from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and moving outward step by step. That sounds like a plan. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>\(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost parentheses: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have another \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something here is the result we just got, which is 4. So, let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3(4)\). Let's compute that: \(3 \times 4 = 12\), then \(1 + 12 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>Moving outward, we have another similar structure. The next layer is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where something is now 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3(13)\). Compute \(3 \times 13 = 39\), then \(1 + 39 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, another layer: <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3(40)\). Compute \(3 \times 40 = 120\), then \(1 + 120 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>Hmm, this is getting bigger each time. Let me keep track of each step. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3(121)\). So, \(3 \times 121 = 363\), then \(1 + 363 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3(364)\). Compute \(3 \times 364 = 1092\), then \(1 + 1092 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3(1093)\). Let me calculate \(3 \times 1093\). Hmm, 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, \(1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3(3280)\). Compute \(3 \times 3280\). Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 + 240 = 9840. Then, \(1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3(9841)\). Let me compute \(3 \times 9841\). Breaking it down: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then, \(1 + 29523 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that multiplication because 9841 is a large number. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 9841 * 3 directly. <nEwLiNe>9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 1 * 3 = 3 <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>- 8 * 3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>- 9 * 3 = 27 + 2 = 29, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>- There's no more digits, so just add the carryover 2 at the beginning. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 29523. Yes, that's correct. So, 9841 * 3 = 29523, and then 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>9. So, the result of the ninth layer is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I think I miscounted. Let me recount the layers because I might have gone too far. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Then: (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, moving outward, so how many layers are there? Let me count. <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each layer is a 1 + 3(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3(3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3(9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3(...). Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the result of layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing layer 9 as 29524, we need to compute 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>- 2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7 <nEwLiNe>- 5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>- 9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>- 2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8 <nEwLiNe>- There are no more digits, so just write down the carryover if any, but here it's 0. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>x    3 <nEwLiNe>------ <nEwLiNe>? <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 1 = 7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 9 * 3 = 27, plus 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Next digit: 2 * 3 = 6, plus 2 = 8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 * 3 = <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that doesn't match my previous result. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, in my initial approach, I was multiplying by 3 each time, but now I'm seeing that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So perhaps my first method was wrong because I didn't account for the multiplication correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me try this again, more carefully: <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>x    3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>Compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from top to bottom, we have 8 8 5 7 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding all together: 60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I did it step by step, I thought I had 88572, but when I tried another approach, I got 36084. That was a mistake. It seems that the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check my layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))) step by step, with each layer: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, I think my initial calculation was right, but I confused myself when I tried a different approach earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me try computing it another way, maybe using a different method, perhaps expanding the expression or looking for a pattern or formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is of the form \(a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation to find a general formula for \(a_n\). <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is \(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is \(a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\). The characteristic equation is \(r - 3 = 0\), so \(r = 3\). Therefore, the homogeneous solution is \(A \cdot 3^n\). <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution \(a_p = C\). <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: \(C = 1 + 3C\). <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: \(C - 3C = 1\) => \(-2C = 1\) => \(C = -1/2\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = A \cdot 3^n + (-1/2)\). <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition \(a_1 = 4\): <nEwLiNe>\(4 = A \cdot 3^1 + (-1/2)\) <nEwLiNe>\(4 = 3A - 1/2\) <nEwLiNe>Adding 1/2 to both sides: \(4 + 1/2 = 3A\) => \(9/2 = 3A\) => \(A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = (3/2) \cdot 3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2\). <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the layers we computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: \(a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: \(a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: \(a_3 = (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: \(a_4 = (3^5 - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: \(a_5 = (3^6 - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: \(a_6 = (3^7 - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: \(a_7 = (3^8 - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: \(a_8 = (3^9 - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: \(a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect! So, the formula works for each layer. Therefore, after 9 layers, the result is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this, which is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute \(3^{10}\): <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with a 3 multiplied by (1 + something). It seems like it's repeated multiple times. Maybe I can work from the inside out? That is, start solving the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count how many times the nesting happens. Each time, there's a 3 multiplied by a term that has another 3 inside. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost one. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3(1 + ... starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I see that after the first 3(1 +, there are 8 more 3(1 +... So, in total, it's 9 layers. Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the opening parentheses after each 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + ... 8 more... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each ""3("" is a new layer. So, starting from the left, the first 3( is the outermost, and the innermost is the last one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should reverse it. Let's consider the innermost parentheses as the 9th term. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... So, each time, a new 3(1 + is added. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: (1 + 3). Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, if I denote each step as a_i, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1), a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2), and so on, until a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), that's 4. Then, moving out, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Hmm, so each time, I'm multiplying 3 by one more than the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make a table: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is built from the inside out. Let me number the layers from the inside out as layers 1 to 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if I follow this, each layer is computed by taking the previous layer, adding 1, multiplying by 3. So, starting from Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 15, Layer3 = 48, etc., up to Layer9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplications. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: <nEwLiNe>1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000 + 900 = 3900, +90 = 3990, +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Compute 4009*3: <nEwLiNe>4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000 +27=12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Compute 12028*3: <nEwLiNe>12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So, 36000 +84=36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check: Is Layer9 the outermost layer? Because in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have 9 layers, each layer being 3*(1 + previous), then yes, Layer9 is the outermost. So, the entire expression is equal to Layer9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can compute it in a different way, perhaps by recognizing a pattern or using a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if I let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive sequence. Maybe I can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n <<INJECTED THINKING>> <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, the outermost layer, which is Layer 9, equals 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I should double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. Let me verify a few of them: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>All the layers check out. So, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer is calculated by multiplying 3 with one more than the result of the previous layer. After computing all layers up to the ninth, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"

Okay, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). It looks like a bunch of nested expressions with a lot of 1s and 3s. Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me start by looking at the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these nested expressions. So, the innermost part is \(1+3\). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>\(1 + 3 = 4\). Okay, so that simplifies the innermost parentheses. Now, moving one level out, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Since we just found that the innermost something is 4, let me substitute that in. <nEwLiNe>So, the next part becomes \(1 + 3 \times 4\). Let me compute that: \(1 + 12 = 13\). Alright, so now that part simplifies to 13. I'll note that down. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another level, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something here is the 13 we just got. So, plugging that in, we have \(1 + 3 \times 13\). Let me compute that: \(1 + 39 = 40\). So, that simplifies to 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next level is another \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something is now 40, so \(1 + 3 \times 40\). That would be \(1 + 120 = 121\). Hmm, 121. That seems a bit big, but okay. <nEwLiNe>Next, moving out another layer, we have \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something here is 121, so \(1 + 3 \times 121\). Let me compute that: \(1 + 363 = 364\). Wow, that's growing quickly. <nEwLiNe>Continuing on, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where the something is 364. So, \(1 + 3 \times 364\). Calculating that: \(1 + 1092 = 1093\). Hmm, that's a pretty large number. I wonder if there's a pattern here. <nEwLiNe>Let me see, so far the results I've gotten are 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093. Hmm, each time, it seems like each term is multiplied by 3 and then 1 is added. So, each term is \(3 \times \text{previous} + 1\). Let me check that. <nEwLiNe>Starting with 4: <nEwLiNe>- Next term: \(3 \times 4 + 1 = 13\). Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>- Next: \(3 \times 13 + 1 = 40\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>- Next: \(3 \times 40 + 1 = 121\). Right. <nEwLiNe>- Then \(3 \times 121 + 1 = 364\). And \(3 \times 364 + 1 = 1093\). So that's the pattern. <nEwLiNe>So, each step is \(a_{n+1} = 3a_n + 1\), starting from \(a_1 = 4\). Maybe I can use this recurrence relation to find a general formula instead of computing each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but maybe that's overcomplicating things. Since the expression is only 9 layers deep, maybe it's faster to just compute each step one by one. Let me see how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original problem: starting from the innermost, each set of parentheses is one layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. There's one after each 1+3, so let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1+3\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: \(1+3(\text{above})\) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: \(1+3(\text{above})\) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of layers: Let's see, the original expression is \(3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). So, inside the first 3, there are 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I was computing earlier, I only went up to 1093, which was after 6 layers. So, I need to compute 3 more layers. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from 1093: <nEwLiNe>Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093\). Let me compute that: \(1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280\). That would be \(1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems inconsistent with my earlier pattern. Let me double-check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 3 times 1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Then 3 times 3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. Hmm, okay, so that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after 8 layers, the value is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out to the ninth layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841\). Let me compute that: \(1 + 29523 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost expression simplifies to 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire original expression is 3 times that. So, the entire expression is \(3 \times 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: \(3 \times 29524\). Hmm, 29524 times 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking that down: 29,524 x 3. <nEwLiNe>24 x 3 = 72, write down 2, carry over 7. <nEwLiNe>52 x 3 = 156, plus 7 is 163. Write down 3, carry over 16. <nEwLiNe>95 x 3 = 285, plus 16 is 301. Write down 1, carry over 30. <nEwLiNe>29 x 3 = 87, plus 30 is 117. So, write down 7, carry over 11. <nEwLiNe>No more digits, so write down 11. <nEwLiNe>Putting it all together: 11 7 3 2 4? Wait, let me do it more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should write it out step by step: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x        3 <nEwLiNe>---------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 x 3 = 12. Write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 x 3 = 15. Write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29,524 x 3: <nEwLiNe>First digit: 4 x 3 = 12. So, write 2, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>Second digit: 2 x 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. Write 7. <nEwLiNe>Third digit: 5 x 3 = 15. Write 5, carry 1. <nEwLiNe>Fourth digit: 9 x 3 = 27 + 1 = 28. Write 8, carry 2. <nEwLiNe>Fifth digit: 2 x 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. Write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems correct. Let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>29,524 x 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 x 3 = (30,000 - 476) x 3 = 90,000 - 1,428 = 88,572. Yes, that matches. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 x 29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in computing the layers, let me go through each step again. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. Hmm, so where did I go wrong earlier? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first approach, I thought the innermost was 4, then 13, 40, etc., but now with this labeling, it's 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which one is correct? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>In the initial problem, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, starting with 4, then 3*(1 + 4) = 15, then 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems correct, but in my first approach, I thought the innermost was 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), not 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let's parse the original expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, the next layer is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my first approach, I was correct, and in the second approach, I messed up the structure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, why? Because in the first approach, I considered each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), which is correct, whereas in the second approach, I mistakenly thought each layer is 3*(1 + previous), but that's not the case. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but actually, in the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer), and then multiplied by 3 on the outside. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, each inner expression is of the form 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my second approach, I misapplied the structure. I thought each layer was 3*(1 + previous), but actually, it's 1 + 3*(next layer). So, the correct way is to start from the innermost, compute each layer as 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply the outermost 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial calculation was correct, leading to 88,572. But when I tried to label the layers differently, I messed up the computation. <nEwLiNe>So, to avoid confusion, I should stick to the first method: starting from the innermost, compute each layer as 1 + 3*(previous result), and then multiply the final result by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me go through it again step by step to make sure. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully going through each step and verifying, I'm confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, maybe I can spot-check a couple of the intermediate steps. <nEwLiNe>For example, after Layer 4: 1 + 3*(121) = 364. Let's verify: <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all the intermediate steps check out. Then, the final multiplication by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the given expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works for these kinds of expressions. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. It seems to be a series of nested 1 + 3(...) terms, each multiplied by 3. So, starting from the innermost part, which is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking back, each level is 1 + 3(...). So, after the innermost is 1 + 3, the next one is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me confirm. <nEwLiNe>Yes, so each time, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, let me break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested part as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let me call the innermost expression as term 1, then each subsequent term adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, term1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>term2: 1 + 3*(term1) <nEwLiNe>term3: 1 + 3*(term2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until term9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of parentheses to be sure. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses: 9. So, there are 9 layers. So, term1 to term9, each term building upon the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, term1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>term2 = 1 + 3*term1 = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>term3 = 1 + 3*term2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to term9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, looking at the original expression, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the entire expression is 3*(term9), where term9 is the innermost expression. Hmm, perhaps I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, 8 more times. So, actually, how many 1 + 3*(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" segments: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each layer adds another ""1 + 3("" until the outermost. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer out adds another ""1 + 3("" until the outermost, which is multiplied by the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. ... and so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so how many layers are there? Each time, we add another layer. Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" adds a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer adds one more ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" expressions. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3( layer1 ) <nEwLiNe>where layer1 is 1 + 3( layer2 ) <nEwLiNe>layer2 is 1 + 3( layer3 ) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>up to layer9, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, there are 9 layers, each being 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from layer9, which is 1 + 3, then layer8 is 1 + 3*(layer9), layer7 is 1 + 3*(layer8), and so on, until layer1, which is the innermost expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, layer1 is the outermost. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ...)). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3), then next is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on, until the outermost layer, which is multiplied by the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of layers is 9, starting from the innermost as layer1, up to layer9 being the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that might be confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times 1 + 3*(...) is nested. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each time we have 1 + 3*(...), and the ... is another 1 + 3*(...). So, how many times does this happen? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" instances: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time we have 1 + 3(, so let's see: <nEwLiNe>The innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, each layer adds another 1 + 3(. <nEwLiNe>So, in the expression, after the initial 3(, we have 1 + 3(, and then inside that, another 1 + 3(, etc., until the innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, how many 1 + 3( are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of ""1 + 3("" is 9, because each opening parenthesis after the initial 3( is a ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3(, then inside that is 1 + 3(, then inside that is another 1 + 3(, and so on, until the innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, how many ""1 + 3("" are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the first ""1 + 3("" is after the initial 3(, then each subsequent ""1 + 3("" is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of ""1 + 3("" is 9, meaning there are 9 layers. Therefore, we have 9 terms, each built upon the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and moving outwards, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>So, let me define each term as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote term1 as the innermost expression: term1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then term2 = 1 + 3*term1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>term3 = 1 + 3*term2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>term4 = 1 + 3*term3 = 1 + 3 <<INJECTED THINKING>> \ <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after computing each layer, the final result is 36084. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Let me recast this in terms of a formula. Each layer n is defined as: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer (n-1)) <nEwLiNe>With Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, each time, we're multiplying the previous result by 3 and then adding 3, because 3*(1 + x) = 3 + 3x. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 3*(1 + x) is 3 + 3x, which is the same as 3x + 3. So, each layer is 3 times the previous layer plus 3. Hmm, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer (n-1)) = 3 + 3*Layer(n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, yes, each layer is 3 more than three times the previous layer. <nEwLiNe>But wait, that might not be the case. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that's not accurate. It's actually 3 times (1 + previous layer). So, it's 3*1 + 3*previous layer, which is 3 + 3*previous layer. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is equal to 3*(previous layer + 1). So, it's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given that, perhaps I can model this as a geometric series or find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>But given that it's only 9 layers, maybe computing each step is manageable. <nEwLiNe>But let me try to see if there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without calculating each layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>Let a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The initial condition is a_1 = 4, but in our case, the recurrence starts at n=1. So, plugging n=1: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>11/2 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's check that: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^n)/6 - 9/6 = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*3^2 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 10*19683 = 196830 <nEwLiNe>Then, add 19683: 196830 + 19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: <nEwLiNe>216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 21 three times (3*6=18), remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 6: 36 <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 36 six times. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 5: 05 <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 5 zero times, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 0: 50 <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 50 eight times (8*6=48), remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>Bring down 4: 24 <nEwLiNe>6 goes into 24 four times. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I computed each layer step by step, I also got 36,084. So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me verify the computation of 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11 * 19683: <nEwLiNe>Breakdown: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then, 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>Divide 216,504 by 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>3 and 6 is 36, 6 into 36 is 6. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>5 and 0 is 50, 6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>2 and 4 is 24, 6 into 24 is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could have noticed that each layer is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and added 3, but since we have a closed-form formula, it's easier. <nEwLiNe>So, in summary, by computing each layer step by step or using the recurrence relation, we arrive at the same result: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar term. It seems like a recursive structure, but since it's finite, I can probably compute it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I can see that there are nine layers here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another expression. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, I can build up the result. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer for clarity. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times the first layer, which itself contains 3 times the next layer, etc. So actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me formalize this. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3A₉. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute each A₁ through A₉ step by step, I can find the value of the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's compute each A step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A₁: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's simple. <nEwLiNe>Now, A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving on. <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, getting bigger. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wow, it's growing exponentially. Let's see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*A₉, so that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*29524. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, just compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>×     3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 × 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 × 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 × 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write 7, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>5 × 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 × 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 × 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write 8, carryover 0. <nEwLiNe>So yes, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my computations because these numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Compute A₁ through A₉: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ is indeed 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*A₉ = 3*29524. Let's compute this more carefully. <nEwLiNe>29524 × 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 × 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 × 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 × 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>24 × 3 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is Aₙ = 3Aₙ₋₁ + 1, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: Aₙ - 3Aₙ₋₁ = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^ <<INJECTED THINKING>> \ <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, is Layer 9 the outermost layer? Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something), which would be Layer 9 as I defined it. So, the total expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. But earlier, I thought it was 88572. There's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is 36084, which is the result of the entire expression. But earlier, when I computed A₉ = 29524, and then 3*A₉ = 88572, which is different. There's a conflict here. I must have misdefined the layers initially. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first approach, I had A₁ = 1 + 3, and then each subsequent Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, up to A₉, and then multiplied by 3. But in the second approach, I started with Layer 1 = 1 + 3, Layer 2 = 3*(1 + Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9 = 3*(1 + Layer 8). So, in the second approach, the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084, but in the first approach, it was 3*A₉ = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This inconsistency is concerning. I need to figure out which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again carefully. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) is Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, Layer3 is 1 + 3*Layer2, etc., up to Layer9, which is 1 + 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer9. So, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I considered Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect. Because in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is (1 + 3*(...)), not multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(something), where something is (1 + 3*(...)). So, if I define Layer9 as (1 + 3*(Layer8)), then the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I was defining Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). So, my initial first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the first approach, I had: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁ = 13 <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*A₂ = 40 <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*A₃ = 121 <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*A₄ = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*A₅ = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*A₆ = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*A₇ = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*A₈ = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>In my second approach, I mistakenly counted Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, my first approach is correct, and the answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>To verify further, let's compute the expression step by step manually, layer by layer, ensuring that I don't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost parentheses first: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result from step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result from step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(result from step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(result from step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(result from step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(result from step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(result from step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(result from step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(result from step9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion earlier came from misdefining the layers in the second approach, where I incorrectly included the outermost 3* as part of Layer9. But upon re-examining the structure, it's clear that Layer9 is just the innermost (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost operation is 3*Layer9. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each step once more: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in this computation. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to approach this problem more formally, recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation, we can model it as a geometric series or use the formula for such a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: Aₙ - 3Aₙ₋₁ = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^h = C*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution Aₙ^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = Aₙ^h + Aₙ^p = C*3ⁿ - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3¹ - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = (3/2)*3ⁿ - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, Aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, since we have A₉, let's compute A₉: <nEwLiNe>A₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: <nEwLiNe>3¹ = 3 <nEwLiNe>3² = 9 <nEwLiNe>3³ = 27 <nEwLiNe>3⁴ = 81 <nEwLiNe>3⁵ = 243 <nEwLiNe>3⁶ = 729 <nEwLiNe>3⁷ = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3⁸ = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3⁹ = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3¹⁰ = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This mathematical approach confirms the result we obtained by step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think this thorough step-by-step computation and verification using both iterative and analytical methods solidifies the conclusion that the expression evaluates to 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \( A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1} \), starting with \( A_1 = 4 \). After computing each layer up to \( A_9 \), the entire expression is \( 3 \times A_9 \), which equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression \( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \) is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \( A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1} \), starting with \( A_1 = 4 \). After computing each layer up to \( A_9 \), the entire expression is \( 3 \times A_9 \), which equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar term. It seems like a recursive structure, but since it's finite, I can probably compute it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I can see that there are nine layers here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another expression. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, I can build up the result. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer for clarity. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times the first layer, which itself contains 3 times the next layer, etc. So actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me formalize this. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3A₉. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute each A step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A₁: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's simple. <nEwLiNe>Now, A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving on. <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, getting bigger. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wow, it's growing exponentially. Let's see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*A₉, so that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*29524. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, that might be more complicated.

Let's compute this more carefully. <nEwLiNe>29524 × 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 × 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 × 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 × 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>24 × 3 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation.

Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\ <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, is Layer 9 the outermost layer? Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something), which would be Layer 9 as I defined it. So, the total expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. But earlier, I thought it was 88572. There's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is 36084, which is the result of the entire expression. But earlier, when I computed A₉ = 29524, and then 3*A₉ = 88572, which is different. There's a conflict here. I must have misdefined the layers initially. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first approach, I had A₁ = 1 + 3, and then each subsequent Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, up to A₉, and then multiplied by 3. But in the second approach, I started with Layer 1 = 1 + 3, Layer 2 = 3*(1 + Layer 1), and so on, up to Layer 9 = 3*(1 + Layer 8). So, in the second approach, the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084, but in the first approach, it was 3*A₉ = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This inconsistency is concerning. I need to figure out which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again carefully. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) is Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, Layer3 is 1 + 3*Layer2, etc., up to Layer9, which is 1 + 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer9. So, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I considered Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect. Because in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is (1 + 3*(...)), not multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(something), where something is (1 + 3*(...)). So, if I define Layer9 as (1 + 3*(Layer8)), then the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I was defining Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). So, my initial first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the first approach, I had: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁ = 13 <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*A₂ = 40 <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*A₃ = 121 <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*A₄ = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*A₅ = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*A₆ = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*A₇ = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*A₈ = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>In my second approach, I mistakenly counted Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, my first approach is correct, and the answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>To verify further, let's compute the expression step by step manually, layer by layer, ensuring that I don't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost parentheses first: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result from step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result from step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(result from step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(result from step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(result from step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(result from step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(result from step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(result from step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(result from step9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion earlier came from misdefining the layers in the second approach, where I incorrectly included the outermost 3* as part of Layer9. But upon re-examining the structure, it's clear that Layer9 is just the innermost (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost operation is 3*Layer9. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each step once more: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in this computation. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to approach this problem more formally, recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation, we can model it as a geometric series or use the formula for such a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: Aₙ - 3Aₙ₋₁ = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^h = C*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution Aₙ^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = Aₙ^h + Aₙ^p = C*3ⁿ - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3¹ - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = (3/2)*3ⁿ - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, Aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, since we have A₉, let's compute A₉: <nEwLiNe>A₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: <nEwLiNe>3¹ = 3 <nEwLiNe>3² = 9 <nEwLiNe>3³ = 27 <nEwLiNe>3⁴ = 81 <nEwLiNe>3⁵ = 243 <nEwLiNe>3⁶ = 729 <nEwLiNe>3⁷ = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3⁸ = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3⁹ = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3¹⁰ = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This mathematical approach confirms the result we obtained by step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think this thorough step-by-step computation and verification using both iterative and analytical methods solidifies the conclusion that the expression evaluates to 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \( A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1} \), starting with \( A_1 = 4 \). After computing each layer up to \( A_9 \), the entire expression is \( 3 \times A_9 \), which equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is 1 plus 3 times another similar term. It seems like a recursive structure, but since it's finite, I can probably compute it by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I can see that there are nine layers here, each starting with a 3 multiplied by a term that's 1 plus another expression. Maybe if I compute each layer one by one, starting from the innermost, I can build up the result. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer for clarity. Let's say: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, which is the outermost one, and then the entire expression is 3 times Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again, the entire expression is 3 times the first layer, which itself contains 3 times the next layer, etc. So actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me formalize this. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each nested expression as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3A₉. <nEwLiNe>So, if I compute each A step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with A₁: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, that's simple. <nEwLiNe>Now, A₂ = 1 + 3A₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving on. <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3A₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, getting bigger. <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3A₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wow, it's growing exponentially. Let's see if I can find a pattern here or if I need to compute each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3A₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3A₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3A₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3A₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3A₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*A₉, so that would be 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*29524. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>First, 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, that might be more complicated. Alternatively, just compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>×     3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 (carry) = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 (carry) = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 (carry) = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my computations because these numbers are getting large, and it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>Compute A₁ through A₉: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ is indeed 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*A₉ = 3*29524. Let's compute this more carefully. <nEwLiNe>29524 × 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 × 3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000 × 3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500 × 3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>24 × 3 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me verify with another method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: Aₙ - 3Aₙ₋₁ = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out.

Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.\ <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, is Layer 9 the outermost layer? Let me check. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(something), which would be Layer 9 as I defined it. So, the total expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. But earlier, I thought it was 88572. There's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me recount.

Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 9 is 36084, which is the result of the entire expression. But earlier, when I computed A₉ = 29524, and then 3*A₉ = 88572, which is different. There's a conflict here. I must have misdefined the layers initially. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first approach, I had A₁ = 1 + 3, and then each subsequent Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, up to A₉, and then multiplied by 3.

So, in the second approach, the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084, but in the first approach, it was 3*A₉ = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This inconsistency is concerning. I need to figure out which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again carefully. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) is Layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*Layer1, Layer3 is 1 + 3*Layer2, etc., up to Layer9, which is 1 + 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Wait, no, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer9. So, the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I considered Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect. Because in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is (1 + 3*(...)), not multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's clarify: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost is 3*(something), where something is (1 + 3*(...)). So, if I define Layer9 as (1 + 3*(Layer8)), then the entire expression is 3*Layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I was defining Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). So, my initial first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the first approach, I had: <nEwLiNe>A₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁ = 13 <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*A₂ = 40 <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*A₃ = 121 <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*A₄ = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*A₅ = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*A₆ = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*A₇ = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₉ = 1 + 3*A₈ = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>In my second approach, I mistakenly counted Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), which is incorrect because the outermost operation is 3*(Layer9), not 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, my first approach is correct, and the answer should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>To verify further, let's compute the expression step by step manually, layer by layer, ensuring that I don't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Compute innermost parentheses first: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result from step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result from step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(result from step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(result from step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(result from step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(result from step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(result from step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(result from step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3*(result from step9) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the final answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion earlier came from misdefining the layers in the second approach, where I incorrectly included the outermost 3* as part of Layer9. But upon re-examining the structure, it's clear that Layer9 is just the innermost (1 + 3*(...)), and the outermost operation is 3*Layer9. Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each step once more: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. I don't see any errors in this computation. Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to approach this problem more formally, recognizing that each layer follows a recurrence relation, we can model it as a geometric series or use the formula for such a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence Aₙ = 1 + 3Aₙ₋₁, with A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear non-homogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: Aₙ - 3Aₙ₋₁ = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is Aₙ^h = C*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution Aₙ^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = Aₙ^h + Aₙ^p = C*3ⁿ - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, A₁ = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3¹ - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is Aₙ = (3/2)*3ⁿ - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 - 1/2 = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, Aₙ = (3ⁿ⁺¹ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, since we have A₉, let's compute A₉: <nEwLiNe>A₉ = (3¹⁰ - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: <nEwLiNe>3¹ = 3 <nEwLiNe>3² = 9 <nEwLiNe>3³ = 27 <nEwLiNe>3⁴ = 81 <nEwLiNe>3⁵ = 243 <nEwLiNe>3⁶ = 729 <nEwLiNe>3⁷ = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3⁸ = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3⁹ = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3¹⁰ = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, A₉ = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*A₉ = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This mathematical approach confirms the result we obtained by step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think this thorough step-by-step computation and verification using both iterative and analytical methods solidifies the conclusion that the expression evaluates to 88572. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both approaches led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the recurrence relation \( A_n = 1 + 3A_{n-1} \), starting with \( A_1 = 4 \). After computing each layer up to \( A_9 \), the entire expression is \( 3 \times A_9 \), which equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The expression I need to compute is: <nEwLiNe>\[ 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \] <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems logical because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. <nEwLiNe>First, let's identify the innermost part.

That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>1. **Innermost Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ (1 + 3) = 4 \] <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we replace the innermost parentheses with the result we just got. <nEwLiNe>2. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 \] <nEwLiNe>Alright, that's simple enough. Let's continue this process for each layer, working our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>3. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 \] <nEwLiNe>Hmm, the numbers are getting bigger quickly. Let's keep going. <nEwLiNe>4. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 \] <nEwLiNe>Wow, it's growing exponentially. I wonder if there's a pattern here or if I need to compute each step manually. For now, I'll continue step by step. <nEwLiNe>5. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 \] <nEwLiNe>6. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \] <nEwLiNe>7. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \] <nEwLiNe>8. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \] <nEwLiNe>9. **Next Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   \[ 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \] <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost expression evaluates to 29524. Now, the entire expression is 3 times this result. <nEwLiNe>10. **Final Computation:** <nEwLiNe>    \[ 3 \times 29524 = 88572 \] <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check my computations to make sure I didn't make a mistake with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting again: <nEwLiNe>1.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses! I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way out. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>First, let's rewrite the expression to make it clearer. Each part is 1 plus 3 times something. So, starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that. The innermost parentheses was 1 + 3, which is 4. So, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result of innermost). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving another layer out. The next innermost is 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*13 first: 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression is now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*40)))))) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*121)))) <nEwLiNe>Now, compute 3*121: <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Replace that: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*364))) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*364: <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*1093)) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*1093: <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Replace: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3*3280)) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*3280: <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Replace: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3*9841) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841: <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Replace: <nEwLiNe>3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that step by step. 3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 29524 can be broken down as 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 24. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each step, I multiplied the previous result by 3 and added 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, each time, it's like a geometric progression or something. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is there a pattern here? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524, 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, each term is 3*previous +1. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from 1, each term is 3*previous +1. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). <nEwLiNe>So, it's a recurrence relation where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my computation earlier, the last step was 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_10 should be 88573, but the original expression is 3*(a_9). Wait, maybe I confused the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next is a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>Continuing up to a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, a_10 would be 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 885 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, but that seems different from my previous result. Wait, now I'm confused. <nEwLiNe>In my first approach, I ended up with 88572, but in this second approach, breaking it down layer by layer, I got 36084. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3's after each parenthesis. Starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to count the number of (1 + 3(...)) parts. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving out, each layer is (1 + 3*(...)), so each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. <nEwLiNe>- So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>- Finally, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, so in my first approach, I got 88572, and in my second approach, I got 36084. Clearly, I must have miscounted the layers in the second approach. Let me figure out where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I labeled Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. But actually, in the original expression, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), so it's not 3*(1 + previous layer), but rather (1 + 3*(previous layer)). <nEwLiNe>So, in other words, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), not 3*(1 + previous layer). Therefore, my second approach was incorrect because I multiplied by 3 after adding 1, whereas it should be 1 + 3*(previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, let's correct that. Each layer is computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from Layer1: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*Layer1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*Layer2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*Layer3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*Layer4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*Layer5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*Layer6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*Layer7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*Layer8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, in my first approach, I correctly computed each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), leading to 88572. In my second approach, I incorrectly multiplied by 3 after adding 1, which gave me the wrong result of 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let's verify with a smaller expression. Suppose we have 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, computing directly: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)) = 3(1 + 3(1 + 12)) = 3(1 + 3*13) = 3(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. So that works. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, if I use the layer approach correctly, it gives the right result. So, applying the same method to the original problem, the answer should indeed be 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I initially got confused in my second approach by misapplying the operations, but after correcting that, it aligns with my first method. So, I'm confident now that 88572 is the correct result. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
9,88572,1,25,9892,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That's a lot of nested parentheses! Hmm, it looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me see if I can break this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, right? So starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me actually write it out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let’s say a1 is the innermost expression, and a2, a3, etc., build outward. <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, let me compute each term step by step. <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify each step carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a1: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which goes up to a9, right? So the entire expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. <nEwLiNe>Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm the multiplication step. 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number, right? Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can verify it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the total would be 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. This is conflicting with my previous result. Earlier, I computed 88572, but now I'm getting 108252. Something is wrong here. I need to figure out why. <nEwLiNe>Let me go back. Maybe I miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, let's count the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so why did I get a different answer earlier? Let me check my first approach. <nEwLiNe>In my first approach, I thought of a1 = 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9, then multiplied by 3. But in this approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for the multiplication correctly. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to parse the expression more carefully. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. But the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. Wait, no, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is the inner expression. So the inner expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, I considered a1 to a9, and then multiplied by 3. But perhaps that was incorrect because in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), meaning that each layer is 3*(1 + previous), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my second approach seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first approach, I considered a1 = 1 + 3, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, up to a9, then multiplied by 3. That approach might have been wrong because each layer is 3*(1 + previous), not 1 + 3*previous. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, perhaps my first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, why the discrepancy? In the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I mistakenly thought each layer was 3*(1 + previous), but actually, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the first approach is the correct one, leading to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Let me confirm with smaller expressions. <nEwLiNe>Suppose I have a simpler expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute it both ways. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I do the second approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>But the correct result is 39, which matches the first method. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, both methods give the same result? Wait, no. Wait, in the first method, I compute (1 + 3) = 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 3*13=39. <nEwLiNe>In the second method, I compute Layer1: 3*(1 +3)=12, Layer2: 3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods lead to the same result, but the structure is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the second method, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), but in the first method, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>So, in reality, the second method is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the original expression, is each layer 1 + 3*(inner), or 3*(1 + inner)? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(inner). So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my second approach, I got 108252, which is different. So, why is that? Because in the second approach, I was incorrectly applying the operations. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, in the original expression, each layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(outermost layer). So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with a smaller expression again. <nEwLiNe>Take 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). As above, the result is 39. <nEwLiNe>Using the first approach: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression is 3*a2 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Using the second approach, which was mistakenly done earlier: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 +3)=12. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>So, both lead to the same result, but the second approach is actually misaligned with the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is (1 +3), then each layer is 1 +3*(inner), and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, in the smaller example, 3*(1 +3*(1 +3)) is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)), it's 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original problem, computing each layer as a1 = 1 +3, a2 =1 +3*a1, up to a9, then multiplying by 3, gives the correct result of 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the confusion arose when I tried to model it as layers where each layer was 3*(1 + previous), which is incorrect for this expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner expression. Starting from the innermost parentheses, we compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2. Compute each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_2 = 1 + 3 \times a_1 = 1 + 3 \times 4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_3 = 1 + 3 \times a_2 = 1 + 3 \times 13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_4 = 1 + 3 \times a_3 = 1 + 3 \times 40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_5 = 1 + 3 \times a_4 = 1 + 3 \times 121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_6 = 1 + 3 \times a_5 = 1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_7 = 1 + 3 \times a_6 = 1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_8 = 1 + 3 \times a_7 = 1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   a_9 = 1 + 3 \times a_8 = 1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>3. Finally, multiply the outermost layer by 3: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   3 \times a_9 = 3 \times 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) That's a lot of nested parentheses! Hmm, it looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me see if I can break this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, right? So starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. Let me count how many layers there are. Each time there's a 1 + 3(...), and each of those is multiplied by 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>2. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me actually write it out step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is defined by the previous one. Let’s say a1 is the innermost expression, and a2, a3, etc., build outward. <nEwLiNe>So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, let me compute each term step by step. <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Each step involves multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Let me verify each step carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a1: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. That seems right. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093. 3*1093: Let me compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280. 3*3000=9000, 3*280=840, so 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 3*9841. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Then 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a9 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which goes up to a9, right? So the entire expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 3*a9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 3*29524: 3*20000=60000, 3*9000=27000, 3*500=1500, 3*24=72. <nEwLiNe>Adding up: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 72 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm the multiplication step. 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, 29524 is a 5-digit number, right? Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can verify it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure that I correctly identified the number of layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parenthesesAlright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So the total would be 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. This is conflicting with my previous result. Earlier, I computed 88572, but now I'm getting 108252. Something is wrong here. I need to figure out why. <nEwLiNe>Let me go back. Maybe I miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so why did I get a different answer earlier? Let me check my first approach. <nEwLiNe>In my first approach, I thought of a1 = 1 + 3, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, and so on, up to a9, then multiplied by 3. But in this approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. But the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is Layer 9. Wait, no, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is the inner expression. So the inner expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. So the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, I considered a1 to a9, and then multiplied by 3. But perhaps that was incorrect because in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), meaning that each layer is 3*(1 + previous), and the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my second approach seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first approach, I considered a1 = 1 + 3, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, up to a9, then multiplied by 3. That approach might have been wrong because each layer is 3*(1 + previous), not 1 + 3*previous. Wait, no, actually, in the expression, it's 1 + 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, perhaps my first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(inner layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, why the discrepancy? In the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))), so each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, the first approach was correct. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I mistakenly thought each layer was 3*(1 + previous), but actually, it's 1 + 3*(previous). So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Let me confirm with smaller expressions. <nEwLiNe>Suppose I have a simpler expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute it both ways. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I do the second approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>But the correct result is 39, which matches the first method. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, both methods give the same result? Wait, no. Wait, in the first method, I compute (1 + 3) = 4, then 1 + 3*4 =13, then 3*13=39. <nEwLiNe>In the second method, I compute Layer1: 3*(1 +3)=12, Layer2: 3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods lead to the same result, but the structure is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the second method, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), but in the first method, each layer is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>So, in reality, the second method is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the original expression, is each layer 1 + 3*(inner), or 3*(1 + inner)? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(inner). So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my second approach, I got 108252, which is different. So, why is that? Because in the second approach, I was incorrectly applying the operations. <nEwLiNe>So, to clarify, in the original expression, each layer after the innermost is 1 + 3*(previous layer), and then the entire expression is 3*(outermost layer). So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with a smaller expression again. <nEwLiNe>Take 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). As above, the result is 39. <nEwLiNe>Using the first approach: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression is 3*a2 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Using the second approach, which was mistakenly done earlier: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 +3)=12. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 +12)=39. <nEwLiNe>So, both lead to the same result, but the second approach is actually misaligned with the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the original expression, the innermost is (1 +3), then each layer is 1 +3*(inner), and the outermost is multiplied by 3. So, in the smaller example, 3*(1 +3*(1 +3)) is 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I think of it as 3*(1 + 3*(1 +3)), it's 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>So, the first approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in the original problem, computing each layer as a1 = 1 +3, a2 =1 +3*a1, up to a9, then multiplying by 3, gives the correct result of 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I think my initial approach was correct, and the confusion arose when I tried to model it as layers where each layer was 3*(1 + previous), which is incorrect for this expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88572 <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then added to 1. Let me try to break this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out, starting with the innermost parentheses and working our way outward. So, maybe I should start by evaluating the innermost part first and then work my way outwards. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression with some labels to keep track: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost part: (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer wraps that result into another (1 + 3*(...)). So, there are multiple layers here. Let me count how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I see that there are 9 sets of parentheses, each time multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So, it's like 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine layers. Wait, actually, let me count the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>... and so on, until the ninth layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me parse this. Each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then L2: 1 + 3*L1 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*L2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying the ninth layer by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me try to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each layer: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9). So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step because this seems like a lot, and it's easy to make a mistake in multiplication or addition. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems straightforward. <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4. 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13. 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121. 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364. 3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So 900 + 180 +12=1092. Then 1 + 1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 +9=3279. Then 1 + 3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3280*3. 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So 9000 + 840=9840. Then 1 + 9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So 27000 +2400=29400, +120=29520, +3=29523. Then 1 +29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 is 29524. Then the entire expression is 3*(L9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*29524.  <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3:  <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3=60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3=27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3=60 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 +12=88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me just confirm that I didn't make any mistake in the multiplication steps. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1 to L9, each step seems correct. L9 is 29524. Then 3*29524:  <nEwLiNe>Let me do it another way. 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 29524*3=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me make sure that each layer was computed correctly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from L1: <nEwLiNe>1. L1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 =13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3. L3:1 + 3*13=1 +39=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>4. L4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>5. L5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>6. L6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>7. L7:1 +3*1093=1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but the original expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, the entire expression is 3*(36084) = 108252. Hmm, that's different from what I had earlier. Did I make a mistake? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. In my initial approach, I thought of each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), but in the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer). There seems to be a discrepancy here. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (...))). So, each layer is indeed 3*(1 + previous layer). Therefore, my second approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, I thought of each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), which was incorrect. So, in the first approach, I incorrectly added 1 before multiplying by 3, but actually, it's multiplying by 3 first and then adding 1 inside the parentheses. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so it's 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ...)). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, actually, my second approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the first approach, I incorrectly thought that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), but actually, it's 3*(1 + previous). So, I need to correct that. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again with the correct approach. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost as Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so previously, I had 88572, but now I have 108252. There's a discrepancy here, so I need to figure out which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to nine layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression has nine layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built by wrapping the previous result in 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 +48)=147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 +147)=444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 +444)=1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 +1335)=4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 +4008)=12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 +12027)=36084 <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*36084=108252. <nEwLiNe>So, in my first approach, I incorrectly treated each layer as 1 + 3*previous instead of 3*(1 + previous). That was my mistake. So, the correct value is 108252. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this again step by step because it's easy to make an error in such a long computation. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer1:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:3*(1 +4)=3*5=15. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:3*(1 +15)=3*16=48. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(1 +48)=3*49=147. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:3*(1 +147)=3*148=444. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(1 +444)=3*445=1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:3*(1 +1335)=3*1336=4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(1 +4008)=3*4009=12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:3*(1 +12027)=3*12028=36084. <nEwLiNe>Then the entire expression is 3*(36084)=108252. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the correct answer is 108252. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute Layer9 and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8)=3*(1 +12027)=3*12028. <nEwLiNe>Compute 12028*3: <nEwLiNe>12000*3=36000 <nEwLiNe>28*3=84 <nEwLiNe>So, 36000 +84=36084. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*36084=? <nEwLiNe>Compute 36084*3: <nEwLiNe>30000*3=90000 <nEwLiNe>6000*3=18000 <nEwLiNe>80*3=240 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 90000 +18000=108000, +240=108240, +12=108252. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 108252. <nEwLiNe>I think this is the accurate result. I had initially made a mistake by misapplying the operations, but after correcting that, the result is consistent across multiple computations. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer from the inside out. Starting with the innermost parentheses, each layer is calculated as three times the sum of 1 and the previous layer's result. After computing all nine layers, the final result is obtained by multiplying the ninth layer by 3.  <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Computation:** <nEwLiNe>1. **Layer 1:** \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. **Layer 2:** \(3 \times (1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>3. **Layer 3:** \(3 \times (1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>4. **Layer 4:** \(3 \times (1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\) <nEwLiNe>5. **Layer 5:** \(3 \times (1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\) <nEwLiNe>6. **Layer 6:** \(3 \times (1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>7. **Layer 7:** \(3 \times (1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>8. **Layer 8:** \(3 \times (1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>9. **Layer 9:** \(3 \times (1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is \(3 \times 36084 = 108252\). <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 108252 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses!

Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I counted the layers correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? So starting from the innermost, each step is a layer. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88572 (Layer 10) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so it seems like there are 9 layers of parentheses, each adding one more 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 4, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). Then, after 9 layers, we multiply the result by 3.  <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Now, after 9 layers, we have 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 times this result. So: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Start from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 → 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7 <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15 → 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28 → 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems high, but considering each layer is tripling and adding 1, it might be correct. Let me check the layers again to see if I made a mistake in the computation. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step seems correct. 3*9841 is indeed 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me think again. The expression is 3*(...). So the 3 is multiplied after the entire nested expression is evaluated. So yes, 29524*3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*a, where a is the previous layer. So, this is a geometric series or something similar? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>If we let a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that doesn't match my earlier result. Did I make a mistake somewhere? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me go back. In my initial approach, I was adding 1 and then multiplying by 3 each time, but in this second approach, I thought of it differently. Hmm, perhaps I misapplied the order of operations. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the structure is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the result is 36084, but earlier I got 88572. There's a discrepancy here. I must have misunderstood the structure of the expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the original expression more carefully. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), meaning that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the outermost layer is 36084. But in my first approach, I thought that the expression was 3*(Layer 9), where Layer 9 was 29524. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in how the layers are being counted. Let me try to parenthesize the expression properly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) inside. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 1 + 3(...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3), then: <nEwLiNe>2. Next is (1 + 3*(...)), which is (1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. Then, (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we have 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 9 layers, each time adding a new 1 + 3*(...). Therefore, the total number of multiplications by 3 is 9, and the total number of additions of 1 is also 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first approach, I had Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13, up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*29523 = 29524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), leading to Layer 9 as 36084. <nEwLiNe>Which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) nine times. <nEwLiNe>So, in terms of layers: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving outward, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let's define it properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n as the value after n layers, where a_0 = 1, and each layer is 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I was considering each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), but perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to define it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote E(n) as the expression with n layers. Then: <nEwLiNe>E(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E(2) = 1 + 3*E(1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E(3) = 1 + 3*E(2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>E(9) = 1 + 3*E(8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E(9) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>But in my second approach, I thought of each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), but that might not be accurate. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So, the outermost operation is multiplication by 3, not addition of 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, then each layer is 1 + 3*(...), up to 9 layers, and then the entire expression is 3*(result of 9 layers). <nEwLiNe>So, the 9 layers compute to 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my first approach was correct, and the second approach where I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer) was incorrect because the outermost layer is 3*(...), not 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, I think 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me compute each layer step by step again: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Each layer is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3. <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>At n = 1: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms that the result is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think I was confused earlier when I tried to model each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), but actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is different. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize, by breaking down the expression step by step, computing each nested layer, and then verifying with a recurrence relation and its closed-form solution, I arrived at the conclusion that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
12,88572,1,9,6011,"
Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3)))))))))... Hmm, that looks complicated with all the nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested 3 times (1 plus something). So it's like a chain of operations. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Innermost part: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: 1 + 3*(previous result). Wait, so that would be 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(13). 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Then the next layer: 1 + 3*40. 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, next layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's see, 3*120 is 360, so 3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. 3*121 is actually 363? Let me double-check that. 120*3 is 360, so 121*3 is 360 + 3 = 363. Yes, correct. So 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364. 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. So 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*1093. Hmm, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that right? 3*1093: Let me verify. 1093 * 3: 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Yes, correct. So 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 9841 is a bit larger. Let me compute 9841*3. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. So 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 29524. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. Let's compute 29524*3. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. So 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*88573. Let's compute 88573*3. 80000*3 is 240000, 8000*3 is 24000, 500*3 is 1500, 70*3 is 210, 3*3 is 9. So 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 is 265720. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 265720. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*265720. Let's compute 265720*3. 200000*3 is 600000, 60000*3 is 180000, 5000*3 is 15000, 700*3 is 2100, 20*3 is 60. So 600000 + 180000 is 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 is 797161. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 times that entire expression. So, after computing the innermost part, we went through 9 layers, right? Let me check how many layers there are. The expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, starting from the innermost 1+3, which is the first layer, and each subsequent layer adds another 1+3*(previous). So, let's count the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1+3(1+3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's 9 layers? Let me see. The expression is written as: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...). Let's see, the innermost is 1+3, then 1+3*(1+3), then 1+3*(1+3*(1+3)), and so on until we have 9 layers of 1+3(...). So, that means we have 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the entire nested part, so Layer 9 is the outermost. So, is the total expression equal to Layer 9? Or is Layer 9 multiplied by 3 again? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the original expression. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, if I have 9 layers, the outermost is 3*(something). So, if I compute Layer 9 as 3*(1 + Layer 8), that is indeed the outermost expression. So, the result is Layer 9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations step by step, because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems consistent. Let me verify Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000 + 900 = 3900, +90 = 3990, +18 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000 +27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute 12028*3: 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 20*3=60, 8*3=24. So 30000 +6000=36000, +60=36060, +24=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I was computing from the innermost part, I ended up with 797161, but that was after 9 layers, but I think I miscounted. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in my initial attempt, I was starting from the innermost as 1+3, then each layer was 1 + 3*(previous). So, that's similar to what I did in the second approach, but in the first approach, I was mistakenly calculating 3*(something) each time, but in the second approach, I realized that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, maybe the second approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 15) = 48, etc. So, the layers are correctly computed as 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, 36084 is the result after 9 layers. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my first approach, I was calculating each layer as 1 + 3*(previous), but that might have been incorrect because the outermost layer is multiplied by 3. Wait, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, if we have Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) =15, Layer3: 3*(1 +15)=48, etc., so the final result is Layer9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure by computing a smaller version of the problem. Suppose I have just 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 =4. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 +4)=15. <nEwLiNe>Outermost: 3*(1 +15)=48. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))) = 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(1 +12))=3*(1 +3*13)=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the small example, if I compute it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Start with innermost: 1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 1 +3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: 1 +3*13=40. <nEwLiNe>Then, outermost: 3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the layer approach, it should be 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3)))=3*(1 +3*(1 +3*4))=3*(1 +3*(13))=3*(1 +39)=3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>But according to the layer approach, if Layer1=4, Layer2=3*(1 +4)=15, Layer3=3*(1 +15)=48, Layer4=3*(1 +48)=147, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that suggests that my layer approach is incorrect because for the small example, the result is 120, but according to layers, it would be 147, which is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I must have misapplied the layer approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in whether each layer is 3*(1 + previous) or (1 + 3*previous). Because in the small example, the innermost is 1 +3=4, then next is 1 +3*4=13, then next is 1 +3*13=40, then outermost is 3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, each layer is (1 + 3*previous), except the outermost one which is 3*(1 + ...). So, in the small example, the structure is: 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))). So, starting from innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 +3*Layer1=1 +12=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 +3*Layer2=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*Layer3=120. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, for n layers, we have (n-1) layers of (1 + 3*previous), and the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, in the original problem, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s: Let's see, starting from the innermost, each 3 is part of a (1 +3(...)). So, each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of times we have 1 + 3(...). It seems like there are 9 instances of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1 +3, then 1 +3*(1 +3), and so on until 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, in that case, Layer1: 1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*Layer1=1 +12=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*Layer2=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that conflicts with my earlier calculation where I thought it was 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>In the small example, with 3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))), which has 3 layers of 1 +3*(...), the result was 120. <nEwLiNe>In that case, Layer1:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=40. <nEwLiNe>Then, outermost:3*40=120. <nEwLiNe>So, for n layers of 1 +3*(...), the outermost is 3*(Layer n). <nEwLiNe>So, in the original problem, how many layers of 1 +3*(...) are there? Let's count. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1 +3(...). Each time we go out, we have another 1 +3*(...). <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) So, the innermost is (1 +3), then each subsequent is (1 +3*(...)). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. Each opening parenthesis signifies a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then each (1+3(...) is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, we have: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3*(1 +3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 1 +3*(...). Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>3. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>4. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>5. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>6. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>7. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>8. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>9. ...1 +3*(... <nEwLiNe>So, total of 9 layers of 1 +3*(...), each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, according to the small example, the result is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is the result after 9 layers of 1 +3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute Layer1 to Layer9: <nEwLiNe>Layer1:1 +3=4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2:1 +3*4=1 +12=13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +3*13=1 +39=40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4:1 +3*40=1 +120=121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 +3*121=1 +363=364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6:1 +3*364=1 +1092=1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 +3*1093=1 +3279=3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8:1 +3*3280=1 +9840=9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 +3*9841=1 +29523=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*Layer9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought it was 36,084, but that was when I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous), but now I realize that the outermost is 3*(Layer9), where Layer9 is 1 +3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial mistake was in the layer approach. I had misapplied the multiplication by 3 at each layer, whereas actually, except for the outermost, each layer is (1 + 3*previous), and the outermost is 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, to avoid confusion, maybe it's better to work from the inside out, computing each nested part step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(result from step1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(result from step2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(result from step3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(result from step4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(result from step5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(result from step6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(result from step7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(result from step8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is: <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(result from step9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute it again step by step, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>10. 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*f(n), where n is the number of layers inside. <nEwLiNe>In this case, n=9, so f(9)=29524, and 3*f(9)=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully computing each step and verifying, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
13,36084,0,0,2759,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms, each starting with 3 multiplied by a sum that includes another similar term. It seems like a recursive structure. Maybe I can simplify it by working from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works well with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, the next expression is 3(1 + 3). But wait, the innermost was 1 + 3, which we computed as 4. So, the next level is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3), which is 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Let me clarify. The next level out is 3*(1 + 3). Since the innermost (1 + 3) is 4, the next level is 3*(1 + 4). Wait, is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, maybe I confused the structure. Let me parse the expression more carefully. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, the next term is 3*(1 + 3). But wait, isn't that 3*(previous result)? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each level is 3*(1 + something). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something), where ""something"" is the next level. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, each level, we're multiplying by 3 and adding 3 each time? Wait, no, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each level is 3*(1 + previous level). So, starting from level 1 as 4, then level 2 is 3*(1 + 4) = 15, level 3 is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each level step by step: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + Level 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + Level 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + Level 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + Level 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + Level 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + Level 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + Level 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + Level 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, after computing all levels, the final result is 36084. Hmm, let me verify this step by step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Right. <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yes. <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; so 300+120=420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Let's compute 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Hmm, let's compute 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so 36000+84=36084. Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. Let me just check if I counted the levels correctly. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1+3) is level 1, <nEwLiNe>then each subsequent 3*(1 + ...) adds another level. So, starting from 1, each additional 3*(1 + ...) is another level. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses before the last 1+3, so yes, 9 levels. Therefore, 36,084 is the correct result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to be thorough, let me write out each step with the corresponding level: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 (Level 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 15 (Level 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 48 (Level 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 147 (Level 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 444 (Level 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 (Level 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 400 <<INJECTED THINKING>> <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems pretty straightforward. Each layer is just multiplying 3 by one more than the previous layer's result. Let me verify each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 is definitely 4. No issues there. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Right. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yes, because 49*3 is 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; so 300+120=420+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 445*3: 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So 1200+120=1320+15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000+900=3900+90=3990+18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. 12028*3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So 36000+84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer step by step, the final result is 36,084. I think this makes sense because each layer is a multiple of the previous one, and since we're multiplying by 3 each time and adding 3, the numbers grow quite rapidly. <nEwLiNe>Let me just double-check the number of layers to ensure I didn't miss any or count extra. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each with a 3 multiplying the next layer. So starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, which we've computed. So yes, 36,084 should be the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that 36,084 is the right result for this expression. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It looks like a repeated pattern of multiplying by 3 and adding 1. Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I notice that each time, it's 1 plus 3 times something. So, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>That's easy: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*4 first: 3*4 = 12. Then, 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120. 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363. 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>3*364: Let me compute that. 300*3 is 900, 60*3 is 180, 4*3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>3*1093: Let's see, 1000*3 is 3000, 90*3 is 270, 3*3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3*3280: 3000*3 is 9000, 200*3 is 600, 80*3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*9841: 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, 1*3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let me break it down. 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, 4*3 is 12. Adding up: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(1 + 3*88573). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3*(...)). So, after computing the innermost parentheses, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, after all those steps, the last result I have is 88573. So, the next step is 1 + 3*88573, and then multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the first operation is 3*(...). So, after computing all the innermost parentheses and working outwards, the last operation is multiplying by 3. So, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me count how many times 3*(1 + 3*(...)) occurs. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...) starting from the innermost. Therefore, after 9 layers, we have 88573, and then the entire expression is 3*(88573). So, the final step is to multiply 88573 by 3. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 3*88573: <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down: 80000*3 = 240000, 8000*3 = 24000, 500*3=1500, 70*3=210, 3*3=9. <nEwLiNe>Adding these up: 240000 + 24000 = 264000; 264000 + 1500 = 265500; 265500 + 210 = 265710; 265710 + 9 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 88573*3: <nEwLiNe>3*3=9, write down 9. <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, carryover 2, write down 1. <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 + 2=17, write down 7, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 + 1=25, write down 5, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 + 2=26, write down 6, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 88573: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>3*3=9 <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, write 1, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 + 2=17, write 7, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 + 1=25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 + 2=26, write 6, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But wait, we've reached the end, so we have a carryover 2, which we write as 2. <nEwLiNe>So, the number is 265719. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way: 88,573 * 3. <nEwLiNe>88,573 * 3: 80,000*3=240,000; 8,000*3=24,000; 500*3=1,500; 70*3= <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, that seems different from my previous calculation. Wait, so earlier I got 265,719, but using this layer approach, I get 36,084. That inconsistency is concerning. Maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. When I first started, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplied by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. Wait, but in my second approach, I labeled each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), and ended up with 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, perhaps the confusion is in the number of layers. Let me recount the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see nine sets of (1 + 3(...)). So, that would mean nine layers. But in my first approach, I had nine steps from the innermost, ending at 29,524, then multiplied by 3 to get 88,572. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, when I labeled Layer 1 as (1 + 3), Layer 2 as 3*(1 + Layer 1), etc., I ended up with Layer 9 as 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that suggests that the two approaches are conflicting. Which one is correct? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because I considered each step as 1 + 3*(previous result), but in reality, each step is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36,084. But in my first approach, I ended up with 88,572. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) or (3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, in the first approach, I was computing each 1 + 3*(previous result) step, but in the second approach, each step is 3*(1 + previous result). Which is accurate? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each time it's 1 + 3*(...). So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in the second approach, I was incorrectly applying 3*(1 + previous) instead of 1 + 3*(previous). So, my second approach was wrong because I misapplied the operation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct approach is to compute each layer as 1 + 3*(previous layer), starting from the innermost, and then the entire expression is 3*(last layer). So, in that case, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I computed 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 9)), but actually, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 9)), but Layer 9 was already 1 + 3*(Layer 8). So, perhaps I confused the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If I define Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2 is (1 + 3*(Layer 1)) = 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is (1 + 3*(Layer 2)) = 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this up to Layer 9: (1 + 3*(Layer 8)) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 88,572 is the correct result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial second approach, I thought that each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1), which led to a different result. So, perhaps that approach was wrong because I misinterpreted the structure of the expression. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I should stick to the first approach: each Layer n is 1 + 3*(Layer n-1), starting from Layer 1 = 4, then Layer 2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, Layer 3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, and so on, up to Layer 9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let me compute Layer 9 step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let's compute that carefully. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from bottom up: 8, 8, 5, 7, 2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that would be 88,572. Wait, hold on: <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's write it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier when I thought I had 265,719, that was a miscalculation. Wait, no, actually, in my first approach, I went all the way to 88,572, which is correct. Then, in my second approach, I incorrectly changed the operation order, leading to confusion. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct computation is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute each step again: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, to double-check, maybe I can recognize a pattern or use a formula. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a geometric series perhaps? Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let's solve it: <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 1 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*C - 1/2 => 3*C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer 9, n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms the result using the recurrence relation formula. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. It looks like this: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That seems straightforward. Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the next layer out is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm reading the parentheses correctly. Each time, it's 1 + 3 times the next expression. So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*(result from first layer) = 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*(result from second layer) = 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: 1 + 3*(result from third layer) = 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: 1 + 3*121. Let's compute 3*121 first. 121*3 is 363. Then 1 + 363 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: 1 + 3*364. 364*3 is 1092. Then 1 + 1092 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: 1 + 3*1093. 1093*3 is 3279. Then 1 + 3279 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: 1 + 3*3280. 3280*3 is 9840. Then 1 + 9840 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: 1 + 3*9841. Hmm, 9841*3. Let me compute that step by step. 9000*3 is 27000, 800*3 is 2400, 40*3 is 120, and 1*3 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. So, 1 + 29523 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Tenth layer: 1 + 3*29524. First, compute 29524*3. Let me break that down: 20000*3 is 60000, 9000*3 is 27000, 500*3 is 1500, 20*3 is 60, and 4*3 is 12. Adding those together: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. So, 1 + 88572 is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. Did I compute 29524*3 correctly? 29524 times 3. Let's do it step by step: <nEwLiNe>29524   <nEwLiNe>x      3   <nEwLiNe>--------   <nEwLiNe>Multiply each digit:   <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1.   <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7.   <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1.   <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2.   <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8.   <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. Yeah, that's correct. Then adding 1 gives 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the result of the innermost expression. But wait, the original expression is 3 times that entire thing. So, the entire expression inside is 88573, so 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 88573 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Again, step by step: <nEwLiNe>80000*3 = 240000   <nEwLiNe>8000*3 = 24000   <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500   <nEwLiNe>70*3 = 210   <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9   <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>240000 + 24000 = 264000   <nEwLiNe>264000 + 1500 = 265500   <nEwLiNe>265500 + 210 = 265710   <nEwLiNe>265710 + 9 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*88573 is 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm that 88573*3 is indeed 265719. Let me do it digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>88573   <nEwLiNe>x      3   <nEwLiNe>-------   <nEwLiNe>3*3=9   <nEwLiNe>3*7=21, write down 1, carryover 2   <nEwLiNe>3*5=15 +2=17, write down 7, carryover 1   <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +1=25, write down 5, carryover 2   <nEwLiNe>3*8=24 +2=26   <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 265719. Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost 1+3=4, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), and finally, the entire expression is 3*(the last result).  <nEwLiNe>So, the total computation is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the layers, let me recount how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let me count the number of 1+3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 1+3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1+3(1+3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1+3(1+3(1+3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of 1+3 before the outermost 3(...). So, total layers when unwrapping: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1+3=4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next:1+3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next:1+3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next:1+3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1+3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:1+3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1+3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:1+3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1+3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Next:1+3*29524=88573 <nEwLiNe>11. Finally, 3*88573=265719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, there are 10 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the innermost is layer 1, and the outermost is layer 10, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial calculation, I had 9 layers inside. Hmm, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1 <<INJECTED THINKING>> <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*36084 = 108252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's different from my initial calculation. So I think I miscounted the layers earlier. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, how many layers are there? Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each 1+3 is a new layer. Let me count the number of times 1+3 appears: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3   <nEwLiNe>10. )))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, my first approach was correct with 9 layers inside, leading to the result 265,719. But now, in my second approach, I get 108,252. Hmm, something is wrong here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. In my first approach, I considered 10 layers including the outermost 3, but in the second approach, I considered 9 layers. I think the confusion comes from whether the outermost 3 is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression more carefully. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is: 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )) nine times. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting with Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 10) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3. Therefore, 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8). Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial calculation, I had Layer 1 to Layer 10. So, I think I miscounted. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the first parenthesis after 3 is Layer 1: 1 + 3(...). Inside that, another Layer 2: 1 + 3(...), and so on, until the innermost Layer 9: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the layers are: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 10: 1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, the innermost is Layer 10: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 9: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 1) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Ah, so I had it right the first time. The confusion was in numbering the layers. The innermost is Layer 10, and the outermost inside the initial 3 is Layer 1. Then, multiplying by 3 gives the final result. <nEwLiNe>So, to avoid confusion, let me write down each step clearly: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. (Layer 10) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. (Layer 9) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. (Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. (Layer 7) <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. (Layer 6) <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. (Layer 5) <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. (Layer 4) <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. (Layer 3) <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. (Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573. (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>11. Finally, multiply by 3: 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. Each layer is built upon the previous one, starting from the innermost. So, the result is indeed 265,719. <nEwLiNe>I think I initially confused myself by miscounting the layers, but now it's clear. Each time, we're adding 1 to three times the previous result. This seems similar to a geometric series or a recursive sequence where each term is defined based on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>To double-check, let me see if there's a formula for such expressions. It looks like each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n^{(h)} = C*3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>Then, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), assume a particular solution is a constant A. Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3*A   <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 1   <nEwLiNe>-2*A = 1   <nEwLiNe>A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^{1} - 1/2   <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1/2   <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2   <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for each layer n, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, starting from the innermost layer as n=1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 13, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: a_3 = (81 - 1)/2 = 40, which matches. <nEwLiNe>So, this formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer k, a_k = (3^{k+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our problem, we have 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, the innermost is Layer 10, as per the earlier breakdown. So, for Layer 10: a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. <nEwLiNe>So, a_10 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, using the formula, we can compute the result directly without having to compute each layer step by step. That's pretty efficient. <nEwLiNe>So, generalizing, if we have an expression like 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... + 3(1 + 3))...)), with n layers, the result would be 3*( (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 ). <nEwLiNe>In our case, n = 9, because there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Wait, no, earlier we had 10 layers, but according to the formula, a_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2, which would mean n=10 layers. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is Layer 1. Then, each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, if there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...), then the innermost is Layer 9. Wait, no, it's the other way around. <nEwLiNe>Actually, the number of layers corresponds to the number of times 1 + 3 appears. Let me count again: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Therefore, n=9 layers. Then, the innermost is Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. So, if n=9, then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our earlier step-by-step, the innermost was Layer 10: a_10=88573. Hmm, this discrepancy suggests that perhaps the formula is using a different indexing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is considering the innermost as a_1, so if there are 9 layers, it's a_9. But in our earlier breakdown, the innermost was Layer 10, because we started counting from the innermost as Layer 10. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion is in how we index the layers. The formula assumes that a_1 is the innermost, but in our case, we considered the innermost as Layer 10. <nEwLiNe>So, if we have 9 layers inside the initial 3(...), then a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. Then, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*a_9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573, which is the result before multiplying by the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, in the formula, a_n corresponds to the nth layer from the innermost. So, for 9 layers, a_9 = 29524, then the next layer would be a_{10} = 88573, but in our case, we only have 9 layers, so the outermost is a_9 = 29524, but no, wait, that doesn't make sense because we have to go up to a_10. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to not get bogged down in the formula's indexing and stick to the step-by-step computation, which clearly gave us 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total number of multiplications by 3. Each layer is multiplied by 3, and there are 9 layers inside, so the total multiplier would be 3^9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see. Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the first layer is multiplied by 3 once, the next layer by 3^2, and so on, up to 3^9 for the outermost layer before the final multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps we can express the entire expression as: <nEwLiNe>3 * (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>Which can be written as 3 * S, where S is a sum where each term is 3^k for k from 0 to 9, minus 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. If I expand the expression, each 1 contributes a term multiplied by 3^k, where k is the number of layers above it. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1: it's multiplied by 3^9, then the next 1 is multiplied by 3^8, and so on, up to the outermost 1, which is multiplied by 3^0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>So, the sum S = 1*(3^9) + 1*(3^8) + ... + 1*(3^0) = (3^10 - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the same formula as before. So, S = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*S = 3*(3^{10} - 1)/2 = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 177147. <nEwLiNe>So, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that's not matching our earlier result of 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. If S = (3^{10} - 1)/2, then 3*S = (3^{11} - 3)/2. But 3^{11} is 177147, so 177147 - 3 = 177144. Divided by 2 is 88572. But earlier, we had 3*88573 = 265,719. Hmm, discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If S is the sum inside the initial 3*(...), then S = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, S = 1 + 3*S', where S' is the sum with 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, if n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, that's not matching our earlier step-by-step computation where we had 3*(Layer 1) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the confusion is whether S includes the outermost 1 or not. Let me re-examine. <nEwLiNe>In the formula, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>S_2 = 1 + 3*S_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>S_3 = 1 + 3*S_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>So, S_n = 1 + 3*S_{n-1}, with S_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the general formula is S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, S_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But in our problem, the entire expression is 3*S_9. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, in the step-by-step, we had 3*(Layer 1) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute S_9 using the step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, S_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, I thought the entire expression was 3*(Layer 1) where Layer 1 was 88573, leading to 265,719. So, where is the confusion? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, there are 9 layers of 1 + 3*(...), leading to S_9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 10 layers, leading to 265,719. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 opening parentheses after the initial 3, meaning 9 layers inside. Therefore, S_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial computation, I had 10 layers, leading to 265,719. So, that must be incorrect. Where did I go wrong? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the initial computation, I considered the innermost as Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13. <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 10: 1 + 3*29524 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, with n=9 layers, S_9 = 29524, and the entire expression is 3*S_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>This suggests that my initial step-by-step was incorrect because I considered 10 layers instead of 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(   <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, there are 9 instances of ""1 + 3("", and the innermost is ""1 + 3"". So, that's 10 layers? Wait, no. Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer, but the innermost is just ""1 + 3"", not ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of ""1 + 3("" plus one for the innermost ""1 + 3"". <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, there are 9 ""1 + 3("" and 1 ""1 + 3"", totaling 10 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so maybe the formula should be S_n where n=10. <nEwLiNe>So, S_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*S_10 = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, the confusion was in whether the innermost ""1 + 3"" is considered Layer 1 or Layer 10. <nEwLiNe>In the formula, S_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, where n is the number of layers. If we consider the innermost as Layer 1, then for n=10, S_10 = 88573. Then, the entire expression is 3*S_10 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But according to the expression, there are 9 ""1 + 3("" and 1 innermost ""1 + 3"", making it 10 layers. Therefore, n=10. <nEwLiNe>So, to resolve the confusion, the number of layers is equal to the number of ""1 + 3("" plus one for the innermost ""1 + 3"". <nEwLiNe>Therefore, in this case, n=10, leading to S_10 = 88573, and the entire expression is 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial step-by-step was correct, and the formula also gives the same result when considering n=10. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arose from how we index the layers. If we consider the innermost as Layer 1, then the number of layers is equal to the number of ""1 + 3("" plus one. So, in this case, 9 ""1 + 3("" and 1 innermost ""1 + 3"" makes 10 layers. Therefore, n=10 in the formula, leading to S_10 = 88573, and the final result is 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>To confirm, let me compute S_10 using the formula: <nEwLiNe>S_10 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches the step-by-step computation. Therefore, the final result is 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, the answer is 265,719. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested multiplication that can be evaluated by working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer is computed as \(1 + 3 \times \text{(result of the previous layer)}\). Starting with the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 29524 = 88573\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiply the result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 88573 = 265719\). <nEwLiNe>Thus, the computed value of the expression is: <nEwLiNe>\(\boxed{265719}\"
16,88572,1,12,4497,"
Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses and threes. It looks kind of complicated, but maybe if I break it down step by step, it'll make more sense. I think I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let me count how many layers there are. Each time, it's 1 + 3(...), so I can see that there are nine sets of parentheses here. Each layer is multiplied by 3. So maybe I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out more clearly. The innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, that 4 is inside another 1 + 3(...). So the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now we have 13. Moving another layer out, we do the same thing: 1 + 3*(13). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay, 40. This seems to be growing quickly. Let me keep going. <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, so each time, we're taking the previous result, multiplying by 3, and adding 1. So it's like a recursive formula where each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. That's interesting. So if I denote each step as a_i, then a_1 = 4, a_2 = 13, a_3 = 40, and so on. <nEwLiNe>But maybe there's a pattern or a formula for this kind of sequence. It reminds me of a geometric series or something. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>The general form here is a_i = 3*a_{i-1} + 1. So this is a linear recurrence relation. I remember that for such recursions, you can solve them using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution would be solving a_i - 3*a_{i-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^i. <nEwLiNe>Then, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3*C + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_i = A*3^i - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. When i = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_i = (3/2)*3^i - 1/2 = (3^{i+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, simplifying, a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with the first few terms to see if it works. <nEwLiNe>For i=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For i=2: (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For i=3: (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 =80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula seems to hold. So, in our problem, we have 9 layers. So the innermost is a_1, and the outermost is a_9. So we need to compute a_9. <nEwLiNe>Using the formula, a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the same as when I computed step by step. So that's good. <nEwLiNe>But in the original problem, after computing the innermost parentheses, each time we multiply by 3, but in the formula, the a_i already includes that 3*(previous) +1. So in the original expression, we have 3*(a_9). Wait, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So when I was computing a_i, each a_i is equal to 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, which is exactly the inner expression. Therefore, the entire original expression is 3*a_9, not a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a crucial point. So let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Each a_i is equal to 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, where a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(a_9). So if a_9 = 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let's re-examine. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3*(...), where the ... is 1 + 3*(...). So the innermost is 1+3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So the innermost is 4, then 1 + 3*4=13, then 1 + 3*13=40, and so on, up to a_9=29524. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(a_9), because the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So that would be 3*(a_9). Wait, but in my step-by-step, I had 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), which is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed step by step, I ended up with 29524, which was the innermost result. Wait, no, no, let me go back. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I started with the innermost as 1 + 3=4, then each step was 1 + 3*(previous). So each a_i is 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(a_9). So the total is 3*(a_9). But in my step-by-step computation, I was computing a_9, which is 29524, so the total expression is 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, when I computed step-by-step earlier, I ended up with 29524, but I thought that was the outermost layer. Wait, no, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, each layer is <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that's different from my previous result. Hmm, did I make a mistake earlier? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. I think I confused the total expression. So in the initial step-by-step, I had 29524, but now with this layering approach, I have 36084. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me go through the layering again more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So according to this, the outermost expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I used the formula a_i = (3^{i+1} - 1)/2, I got a_9 = 29524, and then multiplied by 3 to get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused. There must be a misunderstanding in how I'm applying the formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me re-examine the formula. I defined a_i = (3^{i+1} -1)/2, where a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. So in this case, each a_i is the inner expression, not multiplied by 3. So when I computed a_9 = 29524, that was the result of 1 + 3*(previous layer). So in the original expression, which is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), the innermost part is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4. Then each layer is a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. So a_9 = 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in the layering approach, I ended up with 36084. So which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the layering approach. Let me see. When I did the layering, I started with Layer 1 as 1 + 3 = 4, then Layer 2 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is 3*a_1, then Layer 3 as 3*(1 + 15) = 48, which is 3*a_2, etc., up to Layer 9 as 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So in this approach, each Layer i is 3*a_{i-1}, where a_i = 1 + 3*a_{i-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, a_1 = 4, Layer 2 = 3*a_1 = 15, which would be Layer 2, then Layer 3 = 3*a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which is same as Layer 2. Wait, no, that can't be. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the a_i terms. Let me try to clarify. <nEwLiNe>If I define a_i as 1 + 3*a_{i-1}, starting with a_1 = 4, then: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So a_9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>However, in my layering approach earlier, I was computing 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) which is 3*a_9, which is 88572. But when I did the step-by-step layering, I ended up with 36084. So why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the layering approach again. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arises from whether the first layer is 1 + 3 or 3*(1 + 3). Let me clarify the structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by something. That something is (1 + 3*(...)). So the first operation is 1 + 3*(...), which is the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>So perhaps the layering should be: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So earlier, when I was doing the layering, I mistakenly started with Layer 1 as 3*(1 + 3), which was incorrect. The first layer is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)), up to Layer 9, and then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So that explains the confusion. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let me compute it step by step manually. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think earlier, when I did the layering approach, I miscounted the layers or misapplied the formula. But now, by carefully stepping through each layer and then multiplying by 3 at the end, I get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the method works. <nEwLiNe>Let's say we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). Let's compute this step by step. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula: For 3 layers, a_3 = (3^{4} -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 40. Then total expression is 3*40=120. Correct. <nEwLiNe>If I compute manually: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))) = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 12)) = 3*(1 + 3*13) = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So the method works for a smaller case, so likely correct for the larger one. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"
17,88572,1,16,4286,"
Alright, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me see if I can break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Okay, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that innermost part, the expression now becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Alright, so now the next layer is 1 + 3(4). Hmm, let me compute that. But wait, 3(4) is 12, right? So, 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that part, the expression is now: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Moving on, the next part is 1 + 3(13). Let me compute 3(13) first: 3 * 13 = 39. Then, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) <nEwLiNe>Next up is 1 + 3(40). Let's compute 3 * 40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Replacing that, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) <nEwLiNe>Now, compute 1 + 3(121). 3 * 121 is 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Next, compute 1 + 3(364). 3 * 364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Now, replacing that, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))) <nEwLiNe>Next step: 1 + 3(1093). 3 * 1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Replacing that, expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) <nEwLiNe>Compute 1 + 3(3280). 3 * 3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Now, replacing that, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841)) <nEwLiNe>Next, compute 1 + 3(9841). 3 * 9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Replacing, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(29524) <nEwLiNe>Finally, compute 3 * 29524. Let me do that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step builds on the previous one, working from the innermost parentheses outward. Each time, I computed the inner expression, substituted it, and moved outward. I didn't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I think 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a series of nested 3(1 + ...) terms. Let me see if I can represent this as a recursive formula or something. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote each layer as a term. Let’s say: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is 1 + 3*(previous term). Starting from the innermost term, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me write down the terms: <nEwLiNe>Term1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Term2: 1 + 3*Term1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Term3: 1 + 3*Term2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Term4: 1 + 3*Term3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Term5: 1 + 3*Term4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Term6: 1 + 3*Term5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Term7: 1 + 3*Term6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Term8: 1 + 3*Term7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Term9: 1 + 3*Term8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Term10: 3*Term9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way of looking at it, which confirms the same result. Each term is built from the previous one, multiplied by 3 and adding 1. So, it's like each term follows the recurrence relation: a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula, but since there are only 9 layers (from Term1 to Term9), computing each step is manageable. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, recognizing that each term is following a geometric progression with a multiplier of 3 each time, but offset by the addition of 1 each step. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, this recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is solving a_n = 3 <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, that's different from my earlier result. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial calculation, I ended up with 88572, but now, using this layer approach, I got 36084. These don't match, so I need to figure out where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>Let me go back to the initial expression and see how many layers there are. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(1 + ... parts: starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the parentheses. So, let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) – that's 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial breakdown, I had 9 layers, but when I did the layer approach, I only had 9 layers, ending up with 36084. But in my first calculation, I ended up with 88572, which is significantly larger. So, clearly, I made a mistake in my first approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to redo the first approach more carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, the next expression is 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the layer approach, I started with Layer 1 as 4, Layer 2 as 15, etc., but that seems inconsistent because in the initial expression, the outermost 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), whereas in my layer approach, I considered each layer as 3*(1 + previous layer), starting from the innermost. So, perhaps the confusion is about how many layers are being multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... includes 8 more layers. So, in total, there are 9 multiplications by 3, each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first calculation, I had 9 layers, each time computing 1 + 3*(previous result), except for the outermost one, which is just 3*(result). So, perhaps that's why in my first approach, I had 9 layers, but in the layer approach, I had 9 layers as well, but the results were different. Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers in the layer approach. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), not 1 + 3*(...). So, in my layer approach, I continued up to Layer9 as 1 + 3*(Layer8), but in reality, the outermost operation is just 3*(Layer9). So, that means my Layer9 should be multiplied by 3, not added to 1. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps I made a mistake in the layer approach by adding 1 in the last step. Let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer1 to Layer8 as before: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 9841. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer9: 3*(Layer8) = 3*9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, Layer9 is 3*(1 + ...), which would be 3*(1 + Layer8). So, actually, Layer9 should be 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29526. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result), except for the outermost layer, which is 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>So, let's define: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost operation is 3*Layer9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, in my initial layer approach, I mistakenly included an extra layer where I should have stopped at Layer9 as 29524 and then multiplied by 3 to get the final result. Therefore, the correct final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize, by carefully breaking down each layer and ensuring that I don't miscount the number of operations, I arrive at the conclusion that the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to ensure I didn't make any multiplication errors, I'll recompute the final multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully stepping through each layer and ensuring that I correctly apply the operations, I conclude that the value of the given expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed step by step by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer is calculated as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, the outermost layer is multiplied by 3: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 29524 = 88572\). <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}"
18,29526,0,0,7857,"
Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together. Let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it will make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so the innermost expression simplifies to 4. Now, moving one level out, the next part is 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). So perhaps I need to handle each layer carefully. <nEwLiNe>Let me rewrite the expression for clarity, labeling each layer from the innermost to the outermost. Let's denote each layer as Layer 1 to Layer 9, with Layer 1 being the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 8), where Layer 8 is 1 + 3*(Layer 7), and so on until Layer 1. So, perhaps I should compute each Layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, Layer 2 is 1 + 3*(Layer 1). Plugging in Layer 1's value: <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Moving on to Layer 3: <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Finally, Layer 9 is the entire expression: <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(Layer 8) = 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, and 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication again because 9841 is a large number. Alternatively, I can compute it digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>9841 <nEwLiNe>times 3 <nEwLiNe>------ <nEwLiNe>3*1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3*8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3*9 = 27 + 2 = 29 <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right. <nEwLiNe>Let me recap all the layers to make sure I didn't make a mistake: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Each step seems logical, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. So, unless I made an arithmetic error in one of those steps, the result should be 29,523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check Layer 7 and beyond because those numbers get quite large. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093. Let's compute 3*1093 first. <nEwLiNe>1093 * 3: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 = 3270, 3270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280. Let's compute 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3280 * 3: 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So, 9000 + 600 = 9600, 9600 + 240 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*9841. As before, 9841*3: 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, 29520 + 3 = 29523. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe I can look for a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer, just to verify. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is of the form: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1) <nEwLiNe>With Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recursive relation. Let me see if I can find a closed-form formula for Layer n. <nEwLiNe>The recursive formula is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = 1 + 3*Layer(n-1) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = A*3^n + B <nEwLiNe>Where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let's plug this into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^(n-1) + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right side: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*A*3^(n-1) + 3*B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract 3*B from both sides: <nEwLiNe>-2*B = 1 <nEwLiNe>So, B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, using the initial condition Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 = A*3^1 + B = 3A - 1/2 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>Layer n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^(n+1))/2 - 1/2 = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer n = (3^(n+1) - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this with Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1 = (3^(1+1) <<INJECTED THINKING>> Hmm, that seems different from my initial calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my first calculation, I got 29,523, but now I'm getting 36,084. There must be an error in one of the approaches. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check. Maybe I miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>But in my first approach, I started from Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 as 1 + 3*Layer1, which would be 1 + 3*4 = 13, and so on. But in the second approach, I considered Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15. These are two different methods. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from whether the initial Layer 1 is just (1 + 3) or if it's multiplied by 3 as well. Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So the innermost part is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So actually, the first multiplication by 3 is outside the innermost parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, perhaps my first approach was correct, where Layer 1 is (1 + 3) = 4, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 13, and so on until Layer 9 is 3*(Layer8) = 29,523. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I started with Layer 1 as (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer 2 as 3*(1 + 4) = 15, which might not align with the original structure because the original expression has multiple layers of 3*(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), which is Layer 1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then moving out, each subsequent Layer is 1 + 3*previous Layer, but then multiplied by 3 at the end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Each Layer is 3*(1 + previous Layer). So starting from Layer 1 = (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2 = 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 = 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 = 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 = 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 = 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 = 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 = 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 = 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the final result is 36,084. But earlier, when I computed it differently, I got 29,523. There's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion comes from how I defined the layers. In the first approach, I considered each Layer n as 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), and then the final result was 3*Layer8. In the second approach, I considered each Layer n as 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), starting from Layer1 as 4, which led to a different result. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to reconcile these two approaches. <nEwLiNe>First approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Second approach: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, depending on how I define the layers, I get two different results. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is multiplied by 3, so each layer is indeed 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, starting from Layer1 = (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer2 = 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15, and so on. So the second approach is likely correct, leading to 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the first approach, I ended with Layer9 = 3*Layer8, which was 3*9841 = 29,523. So which one is accurate? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of layers. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Thus, Layer9 is the outermost expression, which is 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, the second approach is correct, and the final result should be 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the first approach, I considered Layer9 as 3*Layer8, which might not align with the structure. Because each Layer is 3*(1 + previous Layer), so the outermost expression is 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, the correct computation is Layer9 = 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial first approach was incorrect because I mistakenly took Layer9 as 3*Layer8, whereas it should be 3*(1 + Layer8). So the correct result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify this again because the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), which includes an additional 1 + inside. Therefore, the final computation should indeed be 3*(1 + Layer8), not just 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But now I'm confused because earlier I had two different results based on how I defined the layers. To resolve this, perhaps I should write out the entire expression step by step, replacing each layer as I go. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Compute the innermost (1 + 3): <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Next innermost (1 + 3): <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Next layer, 1 + 3*13: <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39, 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*40)))) <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Next layer, 1 + 3*40: <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120, 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*121)))) <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Next layer, 1 + 3*121: <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*364))) <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Next layer, 1 + 3*364: <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1093)) <nEwLiNe>Step 7: Next layer, 1 + 3*1093: <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 3*3280) <nEwLiNe>Step 8: Next layer, 1 + 3*3280: <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>= 3*(1 + 9841) <nEwLiNe>Step 9: Next layer, 1 + 9841: <nEwLiNe>1 + 9841 = 9842. <nEwLiNe>= 3*9842 <nEwLiNe>Finally, compute 3*9842: <nEwLiNe>9842 * 3 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm getting 29,526, which is different from both previous results. This is confusing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in Step 9, I had 1 + 9841 = 9842, then 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, in the second approach, I had Layer9 = 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>And in the first approach, I had 3*9841 = 29,523. <nEwLiNe>So, now, by expanding the expression step by step, I get 29,526. <nEwLiNe>This suggests that there might be an error in the step-by-step expansion. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me go through the step-by-step expansion again: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Compute innermost (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*4))))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Compute 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*13)))))) <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Compute 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*40)))) <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Compute 3*40 = 120, then 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*121))) <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Compute 3*121 = 363, then 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*364)) <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Compute 3*364 = 1092, then 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*1093)) <nEwLiNe>Step 7: Compute 3*1093 = 3279, then 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*3280) <nEwLiNe>Step 8: Compute 3*3280 = 9840, then 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 9841) <nEwLiNe>Step 9: Compute 1 + 9841 = 9842, then 3*9842 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step expansion, the result is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, using the second approach, I got 36,084, and using the first approach, I got 29,523. <nEwLiNe>This is perplexing. There must be a miscalculation somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the step-by-step expansion, in Step 9, I had 3*(1 + 9841). But 1 + 9841 is 9842, and 3*9842 is indeed 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I considered Layer9 as 3*(1 + Layer8), where Layer8 was 12027, leading to 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, in the step-by-step expansion, Layer8 was 9841, not 12027. So perhaps in the second approach, I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers in the step-by-step expansion: <nEwLiNe>Step 1: Layer1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Step 2: Layer2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Step 3: Layer3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Step 4: Layer4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Step 5: Layer5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Step 6: Layer6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Step 7: Layer7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Step 8: Layer8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Step 9: Layer9 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>So, in the step-by-step expansion, Layer9 is the final result, 29,526, which is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, I had Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 15, Layer3 = 48, Layer4 = 147, Layer5 = 444, Layer6 = 1335, Layer7 = 4008, Layer8 = 12027, Layer9 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step expansion, Layer8 is 9841, not 12027. So, clearly, the second approach miscounted the layers or misapplied the operations. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the second approach, I considered Layer n as 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), starting from Layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>Layer1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step expansion, Layer8 is 9841, not 12027. So, there's a discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>I think the issue is in how the layers are defined. In the step-by-step expansion, each layer is the result inside the parentheses, not multiplied by 3 yet. So, Layer1 = 4, Layer2 = 13, Layer3 = 40, etc., and the final result is 3*Layer8. <nEwLiNe>In the second approach, I considered each Layer n as 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)), which effectively includes the multiplication by 3 in the layer definition. Therefore, in that case, Layer9 would be the final result. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...), so the final result is 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, Layer8 is the result inside the parentheses before the final multiplication. <nEwLiNe>So, in the step-by-step expansion, Layer8 is 9841, and the final result is 3*(1 + 9841) = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier in the first approach, I had Layer8 as 9841, and then Layer9 as 3*9841 = 29,523, which is slightly different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the first approach, I had: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*9841 = 29,523 <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step expansion, I had: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 9841) = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>So, in the first approach, I mistakenly took Layer9 as 3*Layer8, whereas in reality, Layer9 should be 3*(1 + Layer8), which is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But now, I'm getting conflicting results between the first and step-by-step approaches. I need to resolve this. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the first approach, I considered each Layer n as 1 + 3*Layer(n-1), starting from Layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, the final expression is 3*Layer8 = 3*9841 = 29,523. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step expansion, the final expression is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>This is equivalent to: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the ... is the next layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), but the outermost layer is 3*(1 + Layer8). So, the final result is 3*(1 + Layer8). <nEwLiNe>In the first approach, I incorrectly took the final result as 3*Layer8, whereas it should be 3*(1 + Layer8). Therefore, the correct final result is 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the step-by-step expansion, I ended up with 29,526, but in the first approach, I had 29,523. Let me check that multiplication again. <nEwLiNe>3*9842: 9842 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9000*3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>800*3 = 2,400 <nEwLiNe>40*3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400 <nEwLiNe>29,400 + 120 = 29,520 <nEwLiNe>29,520 + 6 = 29,526 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>In the first approach, I had 3*9841 = 29,523, but actually, the final expression is 3*(1 + 9841) = 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>I must have made a mistake in the first approach by not including the final 1 + before multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, to summarize: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined as 1 + 3*previous layer, starting from Layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the step-by-step expansion, I had Layer8 = 9841, then 1 + 9841 = 9842, then 3*9842 = 29,526. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 29,526. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: \(1 + 3 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>2. Replace and compute the next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>3. Continue this process for each subsequent layer: <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>   - \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>4. Finally, compute the outermost layer: \(3 \times (1 + 9841) = 3 \times 9842 = 29526\). <nEwLiNe>Thus, the result is \(\boxed{29526}\"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a big nested expression. Let me write it out step by step so I can see it better. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part, it's 1 + 3. Then, each subsequent layer is 1 plus 3 times the previous result. Hmm, this seems like a nested expression that repeats several times. Let me count how many layers there are. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a new layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are nine sets of parentheses, right? So, that means we have nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3 multiplied by the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute this step by step, starting from the innermost layer and working my way out. Maybe I can write each step down. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost expression: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check the layers because it's easy to make an error in such a long computation. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer 1: <nEwLiNe>1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Then 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check Layer 9 again: 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>3*9841: 9841*3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 9000*3=27000, 800*3=2400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So, 27000 + 2400 = 29400, 29400 + 120 = 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then 29524*3: 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 29524 is 20000 + 9000 + 500 + 20 + 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 20000*3=60000, 9000*3=27000, 500*3=1500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. So, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. Maybe a geometric series or something? Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, homogeneous solution: C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition: a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the first few layers. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = <<INJECTED THINKING>> Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...Layer 9...), so do I need to multiply this result by 3 again? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the original expression is 3 times the entire nested part, which is 3*(Layer 9). So, if Layer 9 is 36084, then the final result is 3*36084. Let me compute that: 36084*3. <nEwLiNe>36084*3: 30000*3=90000, 6000*3=18000, 80*3=240, 4*3=12. Adding them up: 90000 + 18000 = 108000, 108000 + 240 = 108240, 108240 + 12 = 108252. So, the final result is 108,252. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier when I computed step by step, I got 88,572. Hmm, there must be a mistake here. Let me go back and check my calculations. <nEwLiNe>Starting over, maybe I miscounted the layers or misapplied the formula. Let me try the step-by-step approach again, carefully. <nEwLiNe>Innermost Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so earlier when I tried the other approach, I got 108,252, which is different. It seems I misapplied the layers before. Probably, I miscounted the layers or misapplied the multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether Layer 9 is the innermost or the outermost. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis after the first 3 is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, which is (1+3), that's Layer 1. Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3*(...)). So, in total, how many layers? Let's count the number of (1+3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each ""1+3("" is a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting after the first 3: (1+3(...)), so each subsequent ""("" adds a layer. There are 9 opening parentheses after the first 3, so 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: innermost (1+3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: next one out <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: outermost before the final multiplication by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the computation is correct as Layer 1 to Layer 9, each computed as 1 + 3*(previous layer), ending up with Layer 9 = 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step computation leading to 88,572 is correct, and the later approach where I miscounted the layers led me astray. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula I derived earlier: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer 9: a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>3^10 is 59049. So, 59049 - 1 = 59048. Divided by 2 is 29524. Then, 3*29524 = 88572. Perfect, that matches. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute 3^10 again. <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049. Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a chain of 1s and 3s, each time multiplying by 3. Maybe I can simplify this step by step. Let me write it down more clearly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing the innermost part with 4, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, the next innermost is (1 + 3*4).

Let me count the number of layers: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to layer 9, and then the outermost 3(...). So, actually, 9 layers inside, and then one more multiplication by 3 at the very end. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe not.

Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous).

Wait, actually, in the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, when I compute each layer, it's 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, perhaps the first approach was correct, and the second approach was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Let me double-check: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer).

So, the initial approach was correct, and in the second approach, I incorrectly multiplied each layer by 3, leading to an incorrect total. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value of the nth layer from the inside. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} for n > 1. <nEwLiNe>We can compute a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, computing up to a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Thus, total expression value: 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with my first calculation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence. The general solution can be found. <nEwLiNe>First, write the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the recurrence is nonhomogeneous because of the constant term 1. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume a particular solution is a constant, say A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3*A = 1 => -2*A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2. <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, both the step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula lead to the same result. <nEwLiNe>Thus, I'm confident that the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"
