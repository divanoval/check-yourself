Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a repeated pattern, so maybe I can find a shortcut instead of computing each layer one by one. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that each part is of the form 3 times (1 plus something). So, maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, I can find a pattern or a formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me break it down step by step. The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the next layer out is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me write that down. <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Moving one layer out, we have another 1 + 3. Wait, no, actually, the next layer is 1 + [previous result]. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure: each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let's define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of layers. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*(result of 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3*(result of 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses before the first 1. There are 9 opening parentheses, so that means 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>So, let me denote each layer as L1 to L9, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Compute L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then L2: 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>But wait, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9). Because the outermost is 3*(...). So, after computing L9, which is 29524, then the total expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 * 29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, adding them all together: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my computations because these numbers are getting quite large, and it's easy to make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost 3*(29524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check L9 again: 3*9841. 9841*3: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So, 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. So, L9 is 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. That's correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 29,524 * 3: Let's compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 as: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined by L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>We can solve for A and B using the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, we can write the homogeneous solution and find the particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is L_n^{(h)} = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say L_n^{(p)} = C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, L9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches what I got earlier. So, that's a good check. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*L9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula for L_n, we can write: <nEwLiNe>Total expression = 3*( (3^{10} - 1)/2 ) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^{10}=59049, so 3^{11}=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, either way, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I double-checked both by computing step by step and by solving the recurrence relation, which gave me the same result. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by recognizing a repeated pattern and use a step-by-step approach. <nEwLiNe>We define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 1: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 4: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 5: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 6: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 7: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 8: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 9: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is \(3 \times \text{Layer 9}\). Therefore, we compute: <nEwLiNe>\[ 3 \times 29524 = 88572 \] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final answer is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>\]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Okay, so I have this math problem to solve: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks pretty complicated with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of nested terms where each term is of the form \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Each time, this something is another similar expression. So, it seems like a recursive structure, but maybe I can solve it by starting from the innermost part and working my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to see how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: \(1 + 3\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 1})\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: \(1 + 3(\text{result from step 2})\) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers here because each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer, and counting from the innermost, we have 9 sets. Let me confirm that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is written as \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each ""3("". <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Then inside, another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and so on. Let me count how many times ""1 + 3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>1. After the first 3: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. Again: 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. The innermost one: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, I can compute each layer step by step and substitute back into the previous one. That sounds manageable. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as \(a_n\), where \(n\) is the layer number, starting from the innermost as \(a_1\), then \(a_2\), up to \(a_9\), which is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_1 = 1 + 3\) <nEwLiNe>Then, \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1\) <nEwLiNe>Similarly, \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2\), and so on, until \(a_9\). Then, the final result would be \(3 \times a_9\), because the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the outermost parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking back, the expression is \(3(1 + 3(...))\). So, the outermost is 3 multiplied by \(a_9\), which is \(1 + 3a_8\). So, yes, starting from \(a_1\) up to \(a_9\), then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me compute each \(a_n\) step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with \(a_1\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>Now, \(a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \times 4\). Let me compute that: 3 times 4 is 12, plus 1 is 13. So, \(a_2 = 13\). <nEwLiNe>Next, \(a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \times 13\). 3 times 13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. So, \(a_3 = 40\). <nEwLiNe>Moving on to \(a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \times 40\). 3 times 40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. So, \(a_4 = 121\). <nEwLiNe>Then, \(a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \times 121\). Let's compute 3 times 121: 120 times 3 is 360, plus 3 is 363, so 363. Then, plus 1 is 364. So, \(a_5 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>Next, \(a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \times 364\). Let's compute 3 times 364. 300 times 3 is 900, 60 times 3 is 180, 4 times 3 is 12. Adding them up: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then, plus 1 is 1093. So, \(a_6 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>Proceeding to \(a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \times 1093\). Let's compute 3 times 1093. 1000 times 3 is 3000, 90 times 3 is 270, 3 times 3 is 9. So, adding them: 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, plus 1 is 3280. So, \(a_7 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>Next, \(a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \times 3280\). Calculating 3 times 3280: 3000 times 3 is 9000, 280 times 3 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, plus 1 is 9841. So, \(a_8 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>Finally, \(a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \times 9841\). Let's compute 3 times 9841. 9000 times 3 is 27000, 800 times 3 is 2400, 40 times 3 is 120, and 1 times 3 is 3. Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, plus 1 is 29524. So, \(a_9 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>Now, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by \(a_9\). So, the final result is \(3 \times 29524\). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 times 3. Let's break it down: <nEwLiNe>- 20000 times 3 is 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000 times 3 is 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 times 3 is 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20 times 3 is 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4 times 3 is 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, \(3 \times 29524 = 88572\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. It's easy to make an arithmetic error with such large numbers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>2. \(a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>3. \(a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>4. \(a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>5. \(a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>6. \(a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>7. \(a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>8. \(a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>9. \(a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524\) ✅ <nEwLiNe>Then, \(3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572\). Let me verify 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>- 9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>- 500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>- 20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding: 60000 + 27000 = 87000; 87000 + 1500 = 88500; 88500 + 60 = 88560; 88560 + 12 = 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. Alternatively, I can compute 29524*3 directly: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>times 3 <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing down the digits: 88572. Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I think 88,572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula for this kind of nested expression. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each \(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\), with \(a_1 = 4\). So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>In general, for such a recurrence, the solution can be found using standard techniques. Let me recall. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is \(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1\), with \(a_1 = 4\). <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: \(a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0\). The characteristic equation is \(r - 3 = 0\), so \(r = 3\). So, the homogeneous solution is \(A \cdot 3^n\). <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say \(a_n = C\). <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: \(C = 3C + 1\). Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>\(C - 3C = 1\) => \(-2C = 1\) => \(C = -\frac{1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is \(a_n = A \cdot 3^n - \frac{1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition \(a_1 = 4\): <nEwLiNe>\(4 = A \cdot 3^1 - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>\(4 = 3A - \frac{1}{2}\) <nEwLiNe>Add \(\frac{1}{2}\) to both sides: <nEwLiNe>\(4 + \frac{1}{2} = 3A\) <nEwLiNe>\(4.5 = 3A\) <nEwLiNe>So, \(A = \frac{4.5}{3} = 1.5 = \frac{3}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is \(a_n = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3^n - \frac{1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1}}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with the earlier computed terms to see if it holds. <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 1\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_1 = \frac{3^{2} - 1}{2} = \frac{9 - 1}{2} = 4\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 2\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_2 = \frac{3^{3} - 1}{2} = \frac{27 - 1}{2} = 13\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 3\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_3 = \frac{3^{4} - 1}{2} = \frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For \(n = 4\): <nEwLiNe>\(a_4 = \frac{3^{5} - 1}{2} = \frac{243 - 1}{2} = 121\). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, seems like the formula works. So, in general, \(a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, \(a_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3^{10}\): <nEwLiNe>\(3^1 = 3\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^2 = 9\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^3 = 27\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^4 = 81\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^5 = 243\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^6 = 729\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^7 = 2187\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^8 = 6561\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^9 = 19683\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^{10} = 59049\) <nEwLiNe>So, \(a_9 = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \frac{59048}{2} = 29524\). Which matches what I calculated earlier. Good. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is \(3 \times a_9 = 3 \times 29524 = 88572\). So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula, the entire expression is \(3 \times a_9 = 3 \times \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} = \frac{3^{11} - 3}{2}\). <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3^{11}\): <nEwLiNe>\(3^{10} = 59049\) <nEwLiNe>\(3^{11} = 59049 \times 3 = 177147\) <nEwLiNe>So, \(3 \times a_9 = \frac{177147 - 3}{2} = \frac{177144}{2} = 88572\).

Alright, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Hmm, that looks like a bunch of nested expressions. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. <nEwLiNe>First off, it's a series of multiplications and additions, all nested inside each other. It seems like each layer is of the form \(3(1 + \text{something})\). So, if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, that might be the best approach. Kind of like solving parentheses from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are here. Starting from the left, I see a 3, then a 1, then another 3, and so on. Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each time I see a ""("", that's a new layer. Let me count:  <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then another inside that: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each ""3(1 + 3(...))"" is a layer. Let me count them. Starting from the innermost one: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each layer wraps that with 3(1 + ...), so let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. And this continues until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the original expression properly. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, let's list each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since I can see 9 layers of 3(1 + ...). Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. L1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. L2: 3*(1 + L1) <nEwLiNe>3. L3: 3*(1 + L2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>9. L9: 3*(1 + L8) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is L1 = 1 + 3, then L2 = 3*(1 + L1), and so on up to L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" is a new layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from the left, the first 3(1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent 3(1 + ...) is nested inside. So, how many times does ""3("" appear? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Repeating until the innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the outermost, it's 3*(1 + ...), which is 9 layers deep? Wait, let's count the number of 3(1 + 3(...)) expressions. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the outermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Inside that, another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Repeating until we get to 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let me count the number of times ""3("" appears: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3( is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>- Then, each subsequent 3( is nested inside. So, starting from the first, let's count each opening parenthesis: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" corresponds to a layer. Let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is layer 9: 1 + 3, then layer 8: 3*(1 + layer9), and so on until layer1: 3*(1 + layer2). <nEwLiNe>So, let me compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as L1 to L9, where L9 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, maybe it's better to number them from the innermost as L1 to L9, so that L1 is 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer is built upon the previous. <nEwLiNe>But actually, in programming terms, when you have nested functions, you start from the innermost and work outward. So, maybe it's better to start from the innermost and compute each layer outward. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again because I think I might have miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if L1 is the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then L2 is 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>L3 is 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>L4 is 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>L5 is 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>L6 is 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>L7 is 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>L8 is 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>L9 is 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, if I have 9 layers, starting from L1 to L9, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 3*1. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check the original expression again to make sure I have the right number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""3("" is a new layer. Let me count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) So, the first 3( is layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 3( is layer2. <nEwLiNe>So, how many 3( are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers, yes. So, L1 is the innermost, L9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed L9, I got 36084. But in the original expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, if I have 9 layers, starting from L1 as innermost, then L9 is the outermost. So, the final result is L9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify each step carefully, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 1 + 12027 is 12028, and 3*12028. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>12028 * 3: 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84, so total is 36000 + 84 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 is 36084. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check my calculations because 36084 seems a bit large, but considering it's 9 layers deep, it might be correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each layer step by step, which might be more efficient and reduce the chance of error. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined by L_{n} = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>So, recursively, L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume L_p = A, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 3 + 3*A. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A = 3 + 3A => A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is L_n = C*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, L1 = 4 = C*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3C - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3C => (8/2 + 3/2) = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n})/6 = (11*3^{n-1})/2. <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (11*3^{n-1})/2 - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: L2 = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: L3 = (11*3^2 - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: L4 = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, 11*81 is 891? Wait, 11*80=880, plus 11=891, yes. So, 891-3=888, 888/2=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: L5 = (11*243 -3)/2. 11*243: 243*10=2430, 243*1=243, total=2673. 2673-3=2670. 2670/2=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: L6 = (11*729 -3)/2. 11*729: 729*10=7290, 729*1=729, total=8019. 8019-3=8016. 8016/2=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: L7 = (11*2187 -3)/2. 11*2187: 2187*10=21870, 2187*1=2187, total=24057. 24057-3=24054. 24054/2=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: L8 = (11*6561 -3)/2. 11*6561: 6561*10=65610, 6561*1=6561, total=72171. 72171-3=72168. 72168/2=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: L9 = (11*19683 -3)/2. Wait, 19683 is 3^9? Wait, 3^9 is 19683, yes. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (11*19683 -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>19683*10=196830 <nEwLiNe>19683*1=19683 <nEwLiNe>Total=196830 + 19683 = 216513 <nEwLiNe>Then, 216513 - 3 = 216510 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 216510 / 2 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, that's different from my previous calculation where L9 was 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Earlier, when computing step by step, I got L9 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>But using the formula, I get L9 = 108255. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, there must be a mistake in my recurrence relation approach. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's go back. The recurrence relation I set up was L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But in the original problem, the layers are such that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, yes, that would be L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed step by step, I got L9 = 36084, but the formula gives L9 = 108255. There's a discrepancy here. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the formula again. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I defined L_n as the value at each layer, starting from L1 = 4. Then, L2 = 15, L3=48, L4=147, L5=444, L6=1335, L7=4008, L8=12027, L9=36084. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, L9 = (11*3^8 -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3^8 is 6561, not 19683. 3^9 is 19683. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my earlier step-by-step, I used n=9, but in the formula, if L1 corresponds to n=1, then L9 would be n=9, which is 3^8 in the formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>In the formula, L_n = (11*3^{n-1} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1, it's 3^{0}=1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, it's 3^{8}=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (11*6561 -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*6561: 6561*10=65610, 6561*1=6561, total=72171. <nEwLiNe>72171 -3=72168. <nEwLiNe>72168 /2=36084. <nEwLiNe>Ah! There we go. I mistakenly used 3^9 instead of 3^{n-1}=3^8 for n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = (11*3^{8} -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that matches my step-by-step calculation. So, the formula is correct, and my earlier confusion was due to an incorrect exponent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me verify each step once again. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. So, I can be confident that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding the entire expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote S = 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I can represent this as a sum. <nEwLiNe>But since each term is multiplied by 3 and added inside, it's a bit more complex. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of it as: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. <nEwLiNe>E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>But this is similar to the layers we already computed. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, notice that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each layer is 3 + 3*previous layer. <nEwLiNe>Which is the same as L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1}, which is what I had before. <nEwLiNe>So, solving this recurrence gives us the result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I unroll the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*L_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>= 3 + 3^2 + 3^2*L_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, we get: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n}*L_0 <nEwLiNe>But wait, L1 is 4, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3 + 3*L1 = 3 + 12 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the recurrence, if we unroll it: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*(3 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula we derived earlier. <nEwLiNe>We have L_n = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, L9 = (11*3^8 -3)/2 = (11*6561 -3)/2 = (72171 -3)/2 = 72168/2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after careful step-by-step computation and verifying with a recurrence relation, I can conclude that the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(3(1 + 4) = 3 \times 5 = 15\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(3(1 + 15) = 3 \times 16 = 48\) <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(3(1 + 48) = 3 \times 49 = 147\) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(3(1 + 147) = 3 \times 148 = 444\) <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(3(1 + 444) = 3 \times 445 = 1335\) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(3(1 + 1335) = 3 \times 1336 = 4008\) <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(3(1 + 4008) = 3 \times 4009 = 12027\) <nEwLiNe>9. Outermost layer: \(3(1 + 12027) = 3 \times 12028 = 36084\) <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{36084}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Alright, so I've got this math problem here: Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that looks like a bunch of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I need to remember the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction—PEMDAS. Since all these parentheses are nested, I should start from the innermost one and work my way outwards. That seems logical because each expression inside the parentheses depends on the one inside it. <nEwLiNe>So, let me write this down as a series of steps. The innermost part is \(1 + 3\). Let me compute that first. That's straightforward: \(1 + 3 = 4\).  <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one level out, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). Since the innermost was 4, the next one is \(1 + 3(4)\). Let me compute that. First, do the multiplication: \(3 \times 4 = 12\). Then add 1: \(1 + 12 = 13\). So that simplifies to 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving another level out. The next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something here is the previous result, which is 13. So, it's \(1 + 3(13)\). Again, multiplication first: \(3 \times 13 = 39\). Then add 1: \(1 + 39 = 40\). So now, that's 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next one is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\). The something is 40. So, \(1 + 3(40)\). Multiplication: \(3 \times 40 = 120\). Add 1: \(1 + 120 = 121\).  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 121? Wait, that's a square number. 11 squared is 121, right? Interesting, but maybe that's just a coincidence. Let me keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next level out: \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where something is 121. So, \(1 + 3(121)\). Multiply first: \(3 \times 121\). Let me compute that: 120 x 3 is 360, and 1 x 3 is 3, so total is 363. Then add 1: \(1 + 363 = 364\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, 364? Hmm, that's a number I don't recognize immediately. Maybe it's a multiple of something? Not sure, but I'll keep going. <nEwLiNe>Next expression: \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where something is 364. So, \(1 + 3(364)\). Multiply: 3 x 364. Let me do that. 300 x 3 is 900, 60 x 3 is 180, 4 x 3 is 12. So, 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. Then add 1: \(1 + 1092 = 1093\). <nEwLiNe>Okay, 1093. Hmm, that seems like a prime number, but maybe not. Either way, moving on. <nEwLiNe>Next level: \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), something is 1093. So, \(1 + 3(1093)\). Multiply: 3 x 1093. Let me compute that. 1000 x 3 is 3000, 90 x 3 is 270, 3 x 3 is 9. So, 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then add 1: \(1 + 3279 = 3280\). <nEwLiNe>3280. Hmm, that's a number I can work with. Let me see if I can factor that. 3280 divided by 10 is 328, so 328 x 10. 328 divided by 8 is 41, so 328 is 8 x 41, so 3280 is 8 x 41 x 10, which is 80 x 41. But maybe that's not necessary right now. <nEwLiNe>Moving on, the next expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where something is 3280. So, \(1 + 3(3280)\). Multiply first: 3 x 3280. Let me do that. 3000 x 3 is 9000, 200 x 3 is 600, 80 x 3 is 240. So, 9000 + 600 is 9600, plus 240 is 9840. Then add 1: \(1 + 9840 = 9841\). <nEwLiNe>9841. Hmm, that seems like a big number. Let me see if that's a square. 99 squared is 9801, and 100 squared is 10000. So, 99 squared is 9801, so 9841 is 9801 + 40, which is not a perfect square. Maybe it's a prime? I don't know, but I'll just keep that in mind. <nEwLiNe>Next level: \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), something is 9841. So, \(1 + 3(9841)\). Multiply first: 3 x 9841. Let me compute that. 9000 x 3 is 27000, 800 x 3 is 2400, 40 x 3 is 120, 1 x 3 is 3. So, adding them up: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then add 1: \(1 + 29523 = 29524\). <nEwLiNe>29524. Hmm, that's another big number. Let me see if it's a square. 170 squared is 28900, 180 squared is 32400. So, between 170 and 180. Let's try 172 squared: 172 x 172. 170 x 170 is 28900, 2 x 170 x 2 is 680, and 2 squared is 4. So, 28900 + 680 is 29580, plus 4 is 29584. Hmm, that's more than 29524. So, maybe 171 squared? 171 x 171. 170 x 170 is 28900, 1 x 170 is 170, 1 x 170 is another 170, and 1 x 1 is 1. Wait, that's not the right way. Wait, 171 squared is (170 + 1)^2 = 170^2 + 2*170*1 + 1^2 = 28900 + 340 + 1 = 29241. Hmm, that's less than 29524. So, 172 squared is 29584, which is higher. So, 29524 is between 171 squared and 172 squared, so it's not a perfect square. Alright, moving on. <nEwLiNe>Next, the outermost expression is \(1 + 3(\text{something})\), where something is 29524. So, \(1 + 3(29524)\). Multiply first: 3 x 29524. Let me compute that. 20000 x 3 is 60000, 9000 x 3 is 27000, 500 x 3 is 1500, 20 x 3 is 60, 4 x 3 is 12. So, adding those: 60000 + 27000 is 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 60 is 88560, plus 12 is 88572. Then add 1: \(1 + 88572 = 88573\). <nEwLiNe>88573. Hmm, that's a pretty large number. Let me see if that's a prime. I don't know, but it might be. Alternatively, maybe it's a multiple of something. But regardless, that might be the final result inside the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check my steps again because this seems like a lot of computation. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each step again to verify. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3(4) = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3(13) = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3(40) = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3(121) = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>10. Next: 1 + 3(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. So, the expression inside the outermost parentheses simplifies to 88573. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original problem is 3 multiplied by that expression. So, the entire expression is 3 times 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, I need to compute 3 x 88573. Let me do that. 80000 x 3 is 240000, 8000 x 3 is 24000, 500 x 3 is 1500, 70 x 3 is 210, 3 x 3 is 9. So, adding those: 240000 + 24000 is 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. <nEwLiNe>So, 3 x 88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm that multiplication to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Another way: 88573 x 3. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>3 x 3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3 x 7 = 21, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 x 5 = 15 + 2 = 17, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>3 x 8 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>3 x 8 = 24 + 2 = 26. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: 265719. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 88573 x 3 is indeed 265719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my earlier steps, let me go through the computation one more time, maybe a bit more quickly. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*29524 = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent. Therefore, I think 265,719 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that could simplify this computation without having to compute each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, it's a series of nested expressions where each level is 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, starting from 1, each time we're doing 1 + 3*(previous). That seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think about it. If I denote each step as a term in a sequence, where a1 = 1 + 3 = 4, then a2 = 1 + 3*a1, a3 = 1 + 3*a2, and so on, up to a9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, each term is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1. Solving for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3*A - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, that's a closed-form expression for a_n. Therefore, for n = 9, which is the number of times we're nesting this operation, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. Since a1 corresponds to n=1, which is (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 4, which matches. So, yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, for the innermost expression, which is a1 = 4, but in our problem, we have 9 levels. So, n=9. Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's the result I got earlier for the 9th level. Then, the outermost expression is 3*a9, which is 3*29524 = 88572, and then add 1: 88572 + 1 = 88573, and then multiply by 3? Wait, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, the original problem is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which is 3*(a9). Wait, no. Wait, let's see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the problem, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the entire expression is 3*(a9). But according to the recurrence, a9 is already 1 + 3*a8, which is the innermost expression. Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 sets of parentheses inside. Wait, let me count the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the problem: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. There are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, then each subsequent one adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of layers is 9. So, a9 is the value of the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3, and each layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous). So, the entire expression is 3*(a9). Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*a1, but a1 is 4. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing. Maybe in the problem, the number of layers is 8, not 9. Let me count again. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1+3 is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression has 9 layers of ""1 + 3(...)"". So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, total of 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to a9, which we calculated as 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(a9). Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, if a9 is the innermost expression, then the outermost is 3*(1 + 3*a8). Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the indices. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to model it as a0 = 1 + 3, a1 = 1 + 3*a0, a2 = 1 + 3*a1, ..., up to a8, since there are 9 layers. So, the innermost is a0, and the outermost is 3*a8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. Let me index the layers properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*(layer2) = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to layer9: 1 + 3*(layer8). <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in this case, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 = 1 + 3*(layer8). <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, layer9 = 1 + 3*layer8. <nEwLiNe>But in our earlier approach, we considered a9 = layer9. So, the entire expression is 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>But according to the closed-form formula, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if layer9 is a9, then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*((3^{10} - 1)/2) = (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^{11} is 177147. So, 177147 - 3 = 177144. Then, 177144 / 2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Earlier, I computed the entire expression as 3*(88573) = 265719. <nEwLiNe>But according to this formula, it's 3*a9, where a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 29524. So, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had the expression inside the outermost parentheses as 88573, which is a9 + 1? No, wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If layer1 = 4, layer2 = 13, layer3 = 40, ..., layer9 = 29524. Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step computation earlier, I ended up with 88573 inside the outermost parentheses, which seems conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the layers. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 (layer1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer9) <nEwLiNe>So, layer9 is 29524. Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I had 3*(layer10) where layer10 was 88573, but that's incorrect because the problem only has 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by going one layer too deep. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the original problem again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, how many times does ""1 + 3("" appear? <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>- Then 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>- And so on, until the outermost is 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost: 3(1 + 3(...)) which is the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that would mean there are 9 layers of ""1 + 3(...)"", meaning that the innermost is layer1, and the outermost expression is layer9, which is 1 + 3*(layer8). But in our problem, the outermost is 3*(layer9). So, actually, the entire expression is 3*(layer9), where layer9 is 1 + 3*(layer8). <nEwLiNe>But according to the recurrence, layer9 = 1 + 3*layer8, and layer8 = 1 + 3*layer7, etc., down to layer1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*(1 + 3*layer8). But layer9 is 29524, so 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I computed 1 + 3*29524 = 88573, and then multiplied by 3 to get 265719. But that seems to be incorrect because the outermost expression is only 3*(layer9), not 3*(1 + 3*layer9). So, I think I made a mistake in the initial step-by-step by adding an extra layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial computation was wrong because I considered an extra layer beyond the 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, to clarify, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the first 1 + 3*(...). Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""("" after the first 3 adds a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. The first ""("" after the first 3 is the start of the first layer: 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>3. Then another ""("", so second layer: 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>4. Continuing until the last ""("" before the final "")))..."". <nEwLiNe>So, how many ""("" are there after the first 3? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" introduces a new layer. So, starting from the first 3, the number of ""3("" is 9, but actually, the first 3 is outside, so the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with n layers. Then, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, if n=1, E = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>If n=2, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original problem, n=9 layers. So, n=9. <nEwLiNe>But according to our earlier computation, using the closed-form formula, E = 3*(layer9) = 3*(29524) = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I went one layer beyond, which was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the closed-form, we had a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>But in the original problem, the entire expression is 3*(a_n), where a_n is the result after n layers. So, E = 3*a_n = 3*(3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>If n=9, then E = (3^{11} - 3)/2 = (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that matches the earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I computed up to layer9 = 29524, then thought the outermost expression was 3*(layer9 + 1). But that's incorrect. The outermost expression is simply 3*(layer9), which is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial step-by-step was wrong because I mistakenly added another 1 + 3*layer9, which wasn't part of the original problem. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so why did I get 88573 earlier? Because I incorrectly continued the computation beyond layer9, thinking there was another layer, but actually, the original problem only has 9 layers, so layer9 is the innermost, and the outermost is 3*layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial computation, I had: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's correct. Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had: <nEwLiNe>After layer9: 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But that was a mistake because the original problem doesn't have that extra layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But now I'm confused because I have conflicting results. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the original problem again: <nEwLiNe>Compute \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(4) = 13 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(13) = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(40) = 121 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*(9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*(29524) = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial step-by-step, I mistakenly continued one more layer, leading to 265,719, which is incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but now I'm getting two different results: 88,572 and 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, 265,719 was when I incorrectly added an extra layer. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step again, without adding extra layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, I must have made a mistake earlier by considering an extra layer. Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, another thought: the original problem is written as 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, the first 3 is multiplied by the entire expression inside the first parentheses. So, the first operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), where the inner part is 8 layers deep. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 1 + 3(layer1), which is layer2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost layer, which is layer9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*(layer9). So, layer9 = 29524, so 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought that the expression inside the outermost parentheses was 88573, leading to 3*88573 = 265,719, but that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let me compute it using the closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>We had E = 3*(a_n), where a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>For n=9, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I conclude that the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute it manually again, step by step, without adding extra layers. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost expression is 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, I'm still confused because in my initial step-by-step, I ended up with 265,719, which was incorrect. So, I need to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute the layers: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Compute units place: 4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Tens place: 2*3=6 + 1=7 <nEwLiNe>Hundreds place: 5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>Thousands place: 9*3=27 + 1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>Ten-thousands place: 2*3=6 + 2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think I confused myself earlier by miscounting the layers and adding an extra step, leading to an incorrect result. But after carefully going through it again, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is that each layer follows the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, starting from a1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, a9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can confidently say that the correct answer is 88,572. The expression is a nested multiplication where each layer is of the form \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous result)}\). Starting from the innermost layer and working outwards, each step is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, multiplying the outermost result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\(3 \times 29524 = 88572\) <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
5,88572,1,13,446,"
Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That seems like a good plan because each set of parentheses depends on the one inside it. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let me write down the expression again to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). That's straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>So, replacing the innermost part with 4, the expression now becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each time I compute an innermost parentheses, I have to replace it in the next layer. Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. <nEwLiNe>Actually, the innermost parentheses is the last (1 + 3), which is the ninth layer. Let me count the number of 3s to see how many layers there are. Hmm, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside the previous one. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to approach this step by step, starting from the innermost and moving out. Let me number each parentheses layer from 1 to 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1 result) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2 result) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me clarify how the layers are structured. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(next layer). So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So after computing Layer9, which is 29524, we have to multiply it by 3. <nEwLiNe>So the final result is 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that multiplication again to be sure. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check my layers again because this is a lot of computation, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me go back step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 3: 29524*3=88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So it's a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote L_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>Then, L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1}, with L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but actually, L_1 is the innermost, so starting from L_1 = 4, then L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13, L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is L_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Let me find A and B. <nEwLiNe>From the recurrence: L_n = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Assume solution L_n = A*3^n + B. <nEwLiNe>Plug into recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^n + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify RHS: 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>So equation: A*3^n + B = 1 + A*3^n + 3B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^n from both sides: B = 1 + 3B <nEwLiNe>So, B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is L_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, we can use the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when n=1, L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is L_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, L_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer n has value (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer9, which is n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, L_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048 / 2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches my previous result. Good. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3 * L_9 = 3 * 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. Let me just confirm once more. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I expand the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So each layer is a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>In fact, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>This can be represented as a sum: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*1))) with nine layers. <nEwLiNe>But perhaps it's better to see how many terms we have. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer adds a term when expanded. Let me think about expanding the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, since we have a formula for L_n, which is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, so for n=9, L_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = 29524, then 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Which is 3*(L_9), as we had before. <nEwLiNe>So, to recap: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 29524*3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, each step follows. So, unless I made a multiplication error in any step, which I don't think I did, the result should be 88572. <nEwLiNe>Just to double-check, let's compute Layer9 again: <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*9841: <nEwLiNe>9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But wait, 9841 is 4 digits: <nEwLiNe>9841 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>Compute: <nEwLiNe>1*3=3 <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>8*3=24 +1=25, write 5, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +2=29, write 9, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>But since there are no more digits, we write the carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>So 9841*3=29523 <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer9: 1 + 29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 29524*3=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, I think the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>2.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a series of 1s and 3s multiplied together in a recursive way. Let me try to figure out how to approach this step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built up by repeatedly adding 1 and then multiplying by 3. It seems like each layer adds another 1 and another multiplication by 3. So maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out more clearly. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result: <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>So the next layer is (1 + 12). Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3 again: <nEwLiNe>3 * 13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. Each time, I have to go into the next set of parentheses and compute it step by step. So maybe I should write down each step clearly. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(result) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, (1 + 12) = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Then, (1 + 39) = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Then, (1 + 120) = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Then, (1 + 363) = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Then, (1 + 1092) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next layer: 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Then, (1 + 3279) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Then, (1 + 9840) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of layers to make sure I didn't skip any. Looking back at the original expression, each opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis. Let me count the number of closing parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the end: <nEwLiNe>Each "")))"" represents a closing, so let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost has one closing parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>2. Each subsequent layer adds another closing parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s and parentheses. Each time, the pattern is 3(...), so each layer adds a 3 and a set of parentheses. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>Wait, so how many layers are there? Let me see: the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(...). So the number of layers is equal to the number of times we have 3(... <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I can see that after the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)). So that would mean 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my previous step-by-step, I had 16 layers, which can't be right because the expression only has 9 layers. So I must have miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again. Maybe I should number the layers from inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + Layer2) = 1 + 12 =13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(Layer3)=3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: (1 + Layer4)=1+39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(Layer5)=3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 + Layer6=1 + 120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(Layer7)=3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 + Layer8=1 + 363=364 <nEwLiNe>Layer10:3*(Layer9)=3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer11:1 + Layer10=1 + 1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer12:3*(Layer11)=3*1093=3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer13:1 + Layer12=1 + 3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer14:3*(Layer13)=3*3280=9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer15:1 + Layer14=1 + 9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer16:3*(Layer15)=3*9841=29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but now I'm getting 16 layers, but the original expression only has 9 layers. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe I miscounted the number of layers in the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's analyze the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of closing parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each layer adds a set of parentheses. The innermost is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" is a new layer. So: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""3("" after the initial 3: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So that's 9 layers. Therefore, I should only have 9 layers. So my previous step-by-step was wrong because I went beyond 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let's correct that. Let's do 9 layers, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: (1 + Layer2)=1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(Layer3)=3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 + Layer4=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(Layer5)=3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 + Layer6=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(Layer7)=3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 + Layer8=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after 9 layers, we have 364. But the original expression is 3*(Layer9). So the total expression is 3*364=1092. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3*(Layer9). So after computing Layer9 as 364, we multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>So let's redo the layers properly: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(4) =12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next:3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next:1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next:3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next:1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next:3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next:1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(364)=1092. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial step-by-step, I went up to 16 layers, which was incorrect. So actually, it's only 9 layers, leading to 364, then multiplied by 3 gives 1092. <nEwLiNe>But let me make sure. Let's count the number of parentheses. Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a closing one. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer2: (1 + 3(Layer1)) <nEwLiNe>Layer3: (1 + 3(Layer2)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: (1 + 3(Layer8)) <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9) <nEwLiNe>So total layers inside the 3* are 9, each adding one more layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after computing Layer9 as 364, the entire expression is 3*364=1092. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me compute it step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Compute Layer1: (1 + 3) =4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>Final step:3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 1092. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this with another approach. Maybe by recognizing the pattern. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So starting from 1, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). But in our case, starting from (1 +3), which is 4, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). Wait, no, actually, each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's more like each layer is 1 + 3*(the result of the next layer). So it's a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>But let me think in terms of a recursive formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me define f(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So f(1) =1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, this is different from before. Wait, why the discrepancy? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in my initial step-by-step, I had 9 layers leading to 364, but according to this recursive formula, f(5)=364, and f(6)=1093, which would be 6 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So that's 9 layers inside the initial 3. So according to the recursive formula, f(9) would be the innermost, but in my previous definition, f(n) is the expression with n layers, starting from f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indexing. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the recursive formula, f(n) =1 +3*f(n-1), with f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>So: <nEwLiNe>f(1)=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7)=1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8)=1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9)=1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, we have 9 layers, so f(9)=29524, but then the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier step-by-step. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arises from how I'm indexing the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the original expression, starting from the innermost (1 +3), which is f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me try to write the recursion properly. <nEwLiNe>Let me define f(n) as the value starting from the innermost layer with n layers. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: f(1)=1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>For n=2: f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>For n=3: f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>For n=4: f(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>For n=5: f(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>For n=6: f(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>For n=7: f(7)=1 +3*f(6)=1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>For n=8: f(8)=1 +3*f(7)=1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>For n=9: f(9)=1 +3*f(8)=1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, that contradicts my earlier step-by-step where I thought the expression had 9 layers leading to 364. <nEwLiNe>I think the issue is whether the initial 3 is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost is 3*(...), and inside, there are 9 layers of (1 +3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, in terms of recursion, the innermost is (1 +3)=4, which is f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer adds another 3*(1 + f(n)). Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 +3*f(n+1). <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as f(n) =1 +3*f(n+1), but that would complicate things. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, working from the inside out. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute each layer starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2:3*(Layer1)=12 <nEwLiNe>Layer3:1 + Layer2=13 <nEwLiNe>Layer4:3*(Layer3)=39 <nEwLiNe>Layer5:1 + Layer4=40 <nEwLiNe>Layer6:3*(Layer5)=120 <nEwLiNe>Layer7:1 + Layer6=121 <nEwLiNe>Layer8:3*(Layer7)=363 <nEwLiNe>Layer9:1 + Layer8=364 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer9)=3*364=1092. <nEwLiNe>But according to the recursive formula, if I define f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, then f(1)=4, f(2)=13, f(3)=40, etc., up to f(9)=29524, but that seems too large. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the direction of the recursion. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think of it as each layer is built by going inward. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Compute (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, we have 3*(4)=12 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(13)=39 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(40)=120 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(121)=363 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(364)=1092 <nEwLiNe>So, in total, we have 9 layers of computation, each time either adding 1 or multiplying by 3, alternating. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 1092. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, using the recursive formula, I got a different result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I was indexing the layers incorrectly. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to define f(n) as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1)=1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7)=1 +3*f(6)=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8)=1 +3*f(7)=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9)=1 +3*f(8)=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this contradicts the step-by-step approach where I got 1092. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arises from whether we're starting the count from the innermost or the outermost. <nEwLiNe>In the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost, each layer alternates between adding 1 and multiplying by 3, leading to 9 layers, ending with 364, then multiplied by 3 gives 1092. <nEwLiNe>But in the recursive formula, defining f(n) as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost, f(1)=4, and each subsequent f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1).

So it's a bit confusing. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, working from the inside out, each time, we have to compute the innermost parentheses first, then work our way out. <nEwLiNe>So, step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have: <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(4)=12 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer: <nEwLiNe>3. (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(13)=39 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>5. (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(40)=120 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>7. (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(121)=363 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>9. (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>Finally, the entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(364)=1092 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the result is 1092. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, using the recursive formula, I got a different result. Let me see why. <nEwLiNe>In the recursive formula, I defined f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>But in reality, each layer is f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), but in the step-by-step approach, after computing f(9)=364, the final result is 3*f(9)=1092. <nEwLiNe>So, in the recursive formula, f(9)=364, which is correct, then the entire expression is 3*f(9)=1092. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the confusion was whether the recursive formula includes the final multiplication by 3 or not. <nEwLiNe>So, if we define f(n) as the value inside the nth layer, then the entire expression is 3*f(n). So, f(n) is defined as 1 +3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>Then, f(2)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*40=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*121=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*364=1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7)=1 +3*1093=3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8)=1 +3*3280=9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9)=1 +3*9841=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this contradicts the step-by-step approach. <nEwLiNe>I think the issue is that in the step-by-step approach, we are not following the recursive formula correctly. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's think carefully. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, we have: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3*(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we compute (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, we have 3*(4)=12 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, we have (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(13)=39 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(40)=120 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(121)=363 <nEwLiNe>Then, (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(364)=1092 <nEwLiNe>So, the operations alternate between multiplying by 3 and adding 1, but each time, the multiplication is outside the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so actually, each layer is of the form 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, it's more precise to say that each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). <nEwLiNe>But when computing step-by-step, starting from the innermost, we have to compute the innermost first, then work outward. <nEwLiNe>So, the confusion arises because in the recursive formula, f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), but in reality, when computing step-by-step, we have f(n)=3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, each layer is 1 +3*(next layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define f(n) as the value starting from the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>So, f(1)=1 +3=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*f(2)=1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>f(4)=1 +3*f(3)=1 +120=121 <nEwLiNe>f(5)=1 +3*f(4)=1 +363=364 <nEwLiNe>f(6)=1 +3*f(5)=1 +1092=1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7)=1 +3*f(6)=1 +3279=3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8)=1 +3*f(7)=1 +9840=9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9)=1 +3*f(8)=1 +29523=29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step approach, starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*364=1092 <nEwLiNe>So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the confusion is about whether the multiplication by 3 is part of the layer or outside. <nEwLiNe>In the original expression, the outermost operation is 3*(...), where ... is the entire nested expression. <nEwLiNe>So, the nested expression is (1 +3*(1 +3*(...))), which is f(9)=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*f(9)=88572. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step approach, I ended up with 1092, which is 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the step-by-step approach, I only went up to 9 layers, but in reality, the nested expression has 9 layers, leading to f(9)=29524, then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>But why in the step-by-step approach did I get 364 after 9 layers? <nEwLiNe>Because in the step-by-step approach, I was computing each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>3. (1 +12)=13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>5. (1 +39)=40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 +120)=121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*121=363 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 +363)=364 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, I have 364, which is the value inside the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*364=1092. <nEwLiNe>But according to the recursive formula, f(9)=29524, which is different. <nEwLiNe>I think the issue is that in the recursive formula, f(n) is defined as 1 +3*f(n-1), which assumes that each layer is added on top, but in reality, the layers are nested, so each layer is 1 +3*(next layer), which is different. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the recursive formula should be f(n)=1 +3*f(n+1), but that complicates things. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps the step-by-step approach is correct because we're evaluating the expression from the innermost parentheses outward, which is the standard order of operations. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result should be 1092. <nEwLiNe>But to verify, let's compute the expression with fewer layers and see which approach is correct. <nEwLiNe>Let's take a smaller version of the expression with only 2 layers: <nEwLiNe>3(1 +3(1 +3)) <nEwLiNe>Compute step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer:3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Next layer:1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression:3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Using the recursive formula: <nEwLiNe>f(1)=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*f(1)=13 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression:3*f(2)=39 <nEwLiNe>Which matches. <nEwLiNe>Another test case with 3 layers: <nEwLiNe>3(1 +3(1 +3(1 +3))) <nEwLiNe>Compute step-by-step: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 +3)=4 <nEwLiNe>Next:3*4=12 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +12=13 <nEwLiNe>Next:3*13=39 <nEwLiNe>Next:1 +39=40 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression:3*40=120 <nEwLiNe>Using recursive formula: <nEwLiNe>f(1)=4 <nEwLiNe>f(2)=1 +3*4=13 <nEwLiNe>f(3)=1 +3*13=40 <nEwLiNe>Entire expression:3*f(3)=120 <nEwLiNe>Which matches. <nEwLiNe>So, in both cases, the step-by-step approach and the recursive formula agree when we compute up to f(n) and then multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression with 9 layers inside the initial 3, we should compute f(9)=364, then multiply by 3 to get 1092. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in the recursive formula above, with 3 layers, f(3)=40, then 3*f(3)=120. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for 9 layers, f(9)=364, then 3*f(9)=1092. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I defined f(n)=1 +3*f(n-1), starting from f(1)=4, I got f(9)=29524, which was incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, I think the confusion was in the definition of f(n).

Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how I can tackle this. Maybe I should start from the innermost part and work my way outwards.

Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, I can see that it's 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, and inside that parenthesis, it's 1 plus 3 multiplied by another parenthesis, and this repeats multiple times. Let me count the number of times this happens. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, let's break it down step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. Continue this until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, essentially, each layer is 1 plus 3 times the result of the inner layer. Let me structure this. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a sequence where each term is built from the previous one. Let’s say: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 <nEwLiNe>And so on, until a_9, since I think there are 9 layers of 3s. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3s. Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by a parenthesis, so let's count how many times 3 is multiplied. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then, moving outwards, each time it's 1 + 3*(...), so each 3 corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. So, the outermost layer is 3 multiplied by a_9, where a_9 is the 9th term in the sequence. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9, where a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8, and so on down to a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, I can compute each a_i step by step from a_1 up to a_9, then multiply the final a_9 by 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the steps: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>First, compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29524*3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading the digits from top: 8,8,5,7,2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>Wait, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it as: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>times 3 <nEwLiNe>= 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression simplifies to 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my calculations for each a_i to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a_1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, each step seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for a_i. Let me see if this sequence follows a particular recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + C <nEwLiNe>Where A is a constant determined by initial conditions, and C is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>To find C, set a_n = C, then: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the closed-form is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4=(3^5 -1)/2=(243 -1)/2=242/2=121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524 ✔️ which matches my earlier calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 again. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost part and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>We define a sequence \(a_i\) where each term is built from the previous one.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a repeated pattern of multiplying 3 and adding 1, but it's all nested inside each other. Hmm, I need to figure out a way to compute this without getting lost in all the parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Let me start by breaking it down from the innermost part and work my way out. Maybe if I compute each layer step by step, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3. That's simple, right? <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost part is 4. Now, moving one layer out, I have another 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking again, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So it's like a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step. Let's define each layer as a term. Starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3. Let's call that term1. <nEwLiNe>term1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out one layer, we have term2 = 1 + 3*term1 <nEwLiNe>So, term2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Alright, term2 is 13. Next layer out, term3 = 1 + 3*term2 <nEwLiNe>So, term3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, term3 is 40. Let's keep going. <nEwLiNe>term4 = 1 + 3*term3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>term4 is 121. Next layer: <nEwLiNe>term5 = 1 + 3*term4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>term5 is 364. Continuing. <nEwLiNe>term6 = 1 + 3*term5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>term6 is 1093. Next term. <nEwLiNe>term7 = 1 + 3*term6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>term7 is 3280. Next. <nEwLiNe>term8 = 1 + 3*term7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>term8 is 9841. Then, <nEwLiNe>term9 = 1 + 3*term8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>term9 is 29524. Finally, the outermost layer: <nEwLiNe>term10 = 3*term9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me check that. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3)). So, actually, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, term10 is 3*term9, which is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3. Let's do 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 *3= 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, term10 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip a layer. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, starting from the innermost, which is term1, each term is 1 + 3*previous term, and the outermost is 3*term9. <nEwLiNe>But let me count the number of layers. The expression is written as: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count how many 1 + 3(...) there are. <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each time we have another 1 + 3(...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each 3(1 + ... is a new layer. Starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3(1 + ... So, how many times does this happen? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + ... parts. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the outermost 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let's count the number of 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time we add another 3(...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1.

(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))) <nEwLiNe>10. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the outermost is 3*(...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). So, starting from 1 + 3, which is term1, then term2 is 1 + 3*term1, up to term9, which is 1 + 3*term8, and then the outermost is 3*term9. <nEwLiNe>So, how many terms? From term1 to term9, and then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, term1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>term2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>term3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>term4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>term5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>term6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>term7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>term8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>term9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, term10 = 3*term9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me verify each step again. <nEwLiNe>term1: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>term10: 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, that seems consistent. Each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term, starting from 4, and after 9 layers, we get term9 as 29,524, and then multiply by 3 to get the final result, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's correct. It might be helpful to see if there's a pattern or a formula for such expressions, maybe a geometric series or something similar. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each term is defined as term_n = 1 + 3*term_{n-1}, with term1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general form is term_n = a*term_{n-1} + b, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>In this case, a = 3 and b = 1. <nEwLiNe>The solution to such a recurrence is term_n = C*a^n + (b/(a - 1)). <nEwLiNe>So, term_n = C*3^n + (1/(3 - 1)) = C*3^n + 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, we can use the initial condition to find C. When n = 1, term1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 + 1/2 => 4 = 3C + 1/2 => 3C = 4 - 1/2 = 7/2 => C = 7/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is term_n = (7/6)*3^n + 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify that: <nEwLiNe>(7/6)*3^n = (7/6)*3^n = (7*3^n)/6 = (7*3^{n})/6. <nEwLiNe>So, term_n = (7*3^n)/6 + 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/6: <nEwLiNe>term_n = (7*3^n + 3)/6. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, let's test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>term1 = (7*3^1 + 3)/6 = (21 + 3)/6 = 24/6 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>term2 = (7*9 + 3)/6 = (63 + 3)/6 = 66/6 = 11. Wait, but earlier we had term2=13. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the general formula. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's solve the recurrence properly. <nEwLiNe>Given term_n = 3*term_{n-1} + 1, with term1=4. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is term_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>The particular solution is a constant, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant. <nEwLiNe>Assume term_n^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Then, substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 1 => A - 3A = 1 => -2A = 1 => A = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is term_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition: term1=4. <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3C => 9/2 = 3C => C = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, term_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Ah, that seems better. <nEwLiNe>Testing n=1: <nEwLiNe>(3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>(3^4 -1)/2=(81 -1)/2=80/2=40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Yes, that works. <nEwLiNe>So, term_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, term9 would be (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, term9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2=29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, term10 =3*term9=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form formula confirms the step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times (1 plus 3 times... and so on, with a total of nine 3s. Hmm, that seems like a lot of nested expressions. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I'll write it out to see the pattern better. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's a series of 3s multiplied by expressions that involve 1 plus another 3 times something. It looks recursive, almost like each layer depends on the one before it. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute this from the innermost part outward. That might be easier because each step depends on the previous one. Let's count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each time we have 1 + 3*(next layer). So, starting from the inside, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). But actually, each expression is multiplied by 3 on the outside. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, right? <nEwLiNe>So, let me number the layers from the innermost to the outermost. Since there are nine 3s, that means there are nine layers. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) <nEwLiNe>But wait, no. Because each layer is actually multiplied by 3. Wait, let me check the structure. <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then the next is 3*(1 + that), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define it as a recursive function. Let me denote L(n) as the value of the expression with n layers. So, L(1) would be 1 + 3, L(2) would be 3*(1 + L(1)), L(3) would be 3*(1 + L(2)), and so on, up to L(9). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine 3s. So, how many layers is that? Each 3 is either multiplying or being added. Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of multiplications. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should compute each layer step by step, starting from the innermost. Let me write down each step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost expression: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which is 36084. Is that correct? <nEwLiNe>Let me verify each step because it's easy to make a mistake in the multiplication or addition. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let me compute 12028 * 3: <nEwLiNe>12028 * 3: 12,000 *3 = 36,000; 28*3=84. So, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure that I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each parenthesis adds another layer. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1+3("" adds another layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, inside each parenthesis, it's 1 + 3*(next parenthesis). So, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of ""1 + 3("" segments. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>2. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. ... inside that: 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each time we have a new layer starting with ""1 + 3("", so that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, which is Layer 1: 1 + 3, then Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1), up to Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8). So, yes, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computation I did earlier is correct, ending up with 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again—each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1). So, starting from Layer 1: 4, Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 48, Layer 4: 147, Layer 5: 444, Layer 6: 1335, Layer 7: 4008, Layer 8: 12027, Layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for such a recursive expression. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Each Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, if I let L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)), with L(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)) for n >= 2 <nEwLiNe>With L(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me unroll the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3*(1 + L(n-1)) = 3 + 3*L(n-1) <nEwLiNe>Similarly, L(n-1) = 3*(1 + L(n-2)) = 3 + 3*L(n-2) <nEwLiNe>Substituting back: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2)) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*L(n-2) = 3 + 9 + 9*L(n-2) <nEwLiNe>Continuing this, it seems like each step adds another power of 3. <nEwLiNe>In general, after unrolling k times, we get: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*3 + ... + 3^k + 3^k*L(n - k) <nEwLiNe>If we continue this until k = n - 1, then: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1 - (n - 1)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, but L(1) is 4, so when k = n - 1, we have: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n + 3^n*L(1) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, because L(n - (n - 1)) = L(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n} * 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when we unroll the recurrence, each step adds a term and multiplies the remaining term by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=2: <nEwLiNe>L(2) = 3 + 3*L(1) = 3 + 3*4 = 3 + 12 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier result. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: <nEwLiNe>L(3) = 3 + 3*L(2) = 3 + 3*15 = 3 + 45 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=4: <nEwLiNe>3 + 3*48 = 3 + 144 = 147. <nEwLiNe>So, it seems that L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, unrolling, we get: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1) = 3 + 3*(3 + 3*L(n-2)) = 3 + 3*3 + 3*3*L(n-2) = 3 + 9 + 9*L(n-2) <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 9 + 9*L(n-2) = 3 + 9 + 9*(3 + 3*L(n-3)) = 3 + 9 + 27 + 27*L(n-3) <nEwLiNe>So, the pattern is L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{k} + 3^{k}*L(n - k) <nEwLiNe>When we unroll all the way, we get: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^{n} + 3^{n}*L(1) <nEwLiNe>Since L(1) = 4, which is outside the sum. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L(n) = (3*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1)) + 3^{n}*4 <nEwLiNe>Wait, the sum 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n} is a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Sum = 3*(3^{n} - 1)/(3 - 1) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + 4*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 + (4*3^{n}) <nEwLiNe>Let me write both terms with denominator 2: <nEwLiNe>= (3^{n+1} - 3 + 8*3^{n}) / 2 <nEwLiNe>Factor out 3^{n}: <nEwLiNe>= (3^{n}(3 + 8) - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3^{n+1} is 3*3^{n}, so: <nEwLiNe>= (3*3^{n} + 8*3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>= (11*3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, L(n) = (11*3^{n} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L(1) = (11*3 - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Wait, but L(1) is supposed to be 4. Hmm, that doesn't match. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the unrolling. Let me go back. <nEwLiNe>Wait, when n=1, L(1)=4. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula above, when n=1: (11*3 - 3)/2 = 30/2=15, which is incorrect. So, my formula is wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I messed up the unrolling process. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Given L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1) <nEwLiNe>With L(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute L(2): <nEwLiNe>L(2) = 3 + 3*4 = 15 <nEwLiNe>L(3) = 3 + 3*15 = 48 <nEwLiNe>L(4) = 3 + 3*48 = 147 <nEwLiNe>L(5) = 3 + 3*147 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see if I can find a pattern or a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the terms: <nEwLiNe>L(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>L(2) = 15 <nEwLiNe>L(3) = 48 <nEwLiNe>L(4) = 147 <nEwLiNe>L(5) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Let me compute the ratio between consecutive terms: <nEwLiNe>L(2)/L(1) = 15/4 = 3.75 <nEwLiNe>L(3)/L(2) = 48/15 = 3.2 <nEwLiNe>L(4)/L(3) = 147/48 ≈ 3.0625 <nEwLiNe>L(5)/L(4) = 444/147 ≈ 3.0136 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, the ratio is approaching 3, but it's not a constant ratio. So, it's not a geometric sequence. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's see if L(n) satisfies a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>We have L(n) = 3 + 3*L(n-1) <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is L(n) = 3*L(n-1), whose solution is L(n) = C*3^{n} <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume L_p = A, a constant. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3*A <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>A = 3 + 3A <nEwLiNe>=> -2A = 3 <nEwLiNe>=> A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is L(n) = C*3^{n} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition L(1) = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^{1} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>=> 4 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>=> 3C = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 <nEwLiNe>=> C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 ≈ 1.8333 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>L(n) = (11/6)*3^{n} - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>= (11*3^{n})/6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>= (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, L(n) = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Let me test this with n=1: <nEwLiNe>L(1) = (11*3 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>L(2) = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>L(3) = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48.

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Whoa, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s multiplied and added together. I need to figure out what this equals. Hmm, maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me try that. <nEwLiNe>First, let me rewrite the expression to see it more clearly. It's a series of 3 times (1 + 3 times something). So, starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. So, it's 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*(13). Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, then 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, the next layer is 1 + 3*(40). 3*40 = 120, plus 1 is 121. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, I'm noticing a pattern here. Let me list these out as I go: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Finally, the outermost: 1 + 3*9841 = ? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. The original expression has eight sets of parentheses. Let me count the layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3*(previous result). So, counting how many layers there are: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then layer 2: 1 + 3*(layer1) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 1 + 3*(layer2) <nEwLiNe>- ... <nEwLiNe>- Up to layer 8, since the expression has 8 opening parentheses before the first 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, first layer is 3*(...). Inside is 1 + 3*(...), which is the second layer. Continuing, each 3( adds a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3( before the first 1: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 8 layers of 3*(...). Therefore, starting from the innermost, which is layer 8, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the entire expression is 3*(Layer1 result). So, 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Original expression is 3*(...), where the ... is the inner expression. So, if Layer1 is 9841, then the total expression is 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*9841. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>First, 9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>800*3 = 2400 <nEwLiNe>40*3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1*3 = 3 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check each step because that seems a bit high, but given the number of layers, it might be correct. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer8: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer7: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer6: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer5: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer4: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer3: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer2: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer1: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such expressions? It looks like a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation: a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, we can model this as a recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a linear recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K - 3*K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, at n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = C*3^1 - 1/2 = 3C - 1/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for layer n, which is a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our case, we have 8 layers, so n=8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, a_8 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. So, layer1 is 9841, and the entire expression is 3*9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3*9841: <nEwLiNe>9841 * 3: <nEwLiNe>1*3 = 3 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>8*3 = 24 + 1 = 25, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 2 = 29. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it down: <nEwLiNe>9841 <nEwLiNe>*     3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>29523 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a recurrence relation formula, I'm confident that the result is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{29523}.

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3 times a bunch of nested parentheses. Let me write it down step by step to make sure I understand it correctly. The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of parentheses. It looks like a nested expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. <nEwLiNe>Let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 1) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: 1 + 3*(result from step 2) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we have 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check. Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...), and the expression is repeated 9 times. So, starting from the inside, I can compute each layer one by one. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each step as S1, S2, ..., S9, where S1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, S1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, S2: 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>S3: 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>S4: 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>S5: 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>S6: 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>S7: 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>S8: 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>S9: 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 times the result of the entire nested parentheses. So, after computing S9, which is the outermost parentheses, we still have to multiply it by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 3 * S9. <nEwLiNe>So, let me compute that: 3 * 29524. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 29524 * 3.

Let me go back through each step. <nEwLiNe>S1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>S2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>S3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>S4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121.

So, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>But, just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can think of another way to compute this expression. It seems like each step is a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each step as a_n where a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can find a closed-form expression for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_p = 3*a_p + 1 <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: <nEwLiNe>a_p - 3*a_p = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*a_p = 1 <nEwLiNe>a_p = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3C <nEwLiNe>C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Which matches what I computed earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3^{10} first, which is 59049, then 59049 -1 is 59048, divided by 2 is 29524, multiplied by 3 is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of the entire expression as 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) <nEwLiNe>Which is (3^{11} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, that's another way to compute it. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I've computed it step by step, checked each layer, used a recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression, and verified that both methods give the same result. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by simplifying the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards.  <nEwLiNe>We denote each step as \(a_n\) where \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\). The recurrence relation is \(a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}\).  <nEwLiNe>Using the recurrence relation, we compute each step: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\begin{align*} <nEwLiNe>a_1 & = 1 + 3 = 4, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_2 & = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3 \cdot 4 = 13, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_3 & = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 13 = 40, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_4 & = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3 \cdot 40 = 121, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_5 & = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3 \cdot 121 = 364, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_6 & = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3 \cdot 364 = 1093, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_7 & = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3 \cdot 1093 = 3280, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_8 & = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3 \cdot 3280 = 9841, \\ <nEwLiNe>a_9 & = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3 \cdot 9841 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>\end{align*} <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>The outermost expression is \(3 \times a_9\). Therefore, we compute: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>3 \times 29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>\] <nEwLiNe>We also verified this result using a closed-form expression derived from the recurrence relation, confirming that the result is consistent. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like it's a recursive expression where each layer is 1 plus 3 times something. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built from the inside out. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have: <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>So, the second layer gives me 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 2). So, 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the third layer is 40. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, let's do the fourth layer: <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(result from step 3) = 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer is 121. <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(result from step 4) = 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer gives 364. <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(result from step 5) = 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>Calculating: <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>So, sixth layer is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(result from step 6) = 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer is 3280. <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(result from step 7) = 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>Calculating: <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(result from step 8) = 1 + 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = let's compute 9841*3: <nEwLiNe>First, 9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>800*3 = 2400 <nEwLiNe>40*3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1*3 = 3 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 27000 + 2400 = 29400; 29400 + 120 = 29520; 29520 + 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, ninth layer is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression has nine layers of nesting. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost as step 1, each step adds a layer. So, step 1: 1+3, step 2: 1+3*(1+3), ..., step 9 would be the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with nine sets of parentheses. So, the first multiplication by 3 is outside the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing the innermost nine layers, the result is 29524, and then we have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier steps, each layer was 1 + 3*(previous result). So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so actually, after computing the innermost nine layers, which would give me the value inside the outermost parentheses, which is 29524, then I have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1+3), then each subsequent layer adds a 1 + 3*(previous). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost nine layers result in 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(that result). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) where the inner ... evaluates to 29524. So, 3*29524 is the final step. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Compute: <nEwLiNe>20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when you have multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for such expressions to avoid computing each step manually. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's see if I can solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, whose characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3C = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2C = 1 <nEwLiNe>C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, in our problem, we have 9 layers. Let me see, starting from a_1 = 4, which is n=1, so a_9 would correspond to n=9. <nEwLiNe>Thus, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10} = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches the result I got earlier. Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation formula, I also get 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result is correct. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost layer and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>1.

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance with all those nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that innermost part with 4, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3*4)))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me make sure I did that correctly. The original innermost expression is (1 + 3), which is 4. So the next layer out is (1 + 3*(that result)). So it's 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should write each step more clearly. Let me define each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, L2 is 1 + 3*(L1). So L2 = 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So L2 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving out another layer, L3 is 1 + 3*(L2). So L3 = 1 + 3*13. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>So L3 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 1 + 39 is 40? Wait, 39 +1 is 40, yes. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, L4 is 1 + 3*(L3). So L4 = 1 + 3*40. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>So L4 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 121. That seems familiar, like 11 squared. Interesting, maybe a pattern here. <nEwLiNe>Next layer, L5 = 1 + 3*(L4) = 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>3*121 is... let me compute that. 120*3 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So 3*121 = 363. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, L5 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, okay. Let me keep going. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*(L5) = 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>3*364. Let me compute that. 300*3 = 900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So adding those together: 900 + 180 = 1080, plus 12 is 1092. <nEwLiNe>So L6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 1093. That's a prime number, I think. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to L7 = 1 + 3*(L6) = 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>3*1093. Let's compute that. 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So 3000 + 270 = 3270, plus 9 is 3279. <nEwLiNe>So L7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>3280. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Next layer, L8 = 1 + 3*(L7) = 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>3*3280. Let's see, 3000*3=9000, 200*3=600, 80*3=240. So adding those: 9000 + 600 = 9600, plus 240 is 9840. <nEwLiNe>So L8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9841. Hmm, that number seems familiar. Wait, is that 99 squared? 99*99 is 9801, which is less. 100 squared is 10,000. So no, maybe not. Maybe another square? <nEwLiNe>Wait, 9841 divided by 7: 7*1400=9800, 9841-9800=41, which is prime. So probably not a perfect square. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Moving on to L9 = 1 + 3*(L8) = 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>3*9841. Let's compute that. 9000*3=27,000, 800*3=2,400, 40*3=120, 1*3=3. So adding those: 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400, plus 120 is 29,520, plus 3 is 29,523. <nEwLiNe>So L9 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. <nEwLiNe>29,524. Hmm, okay. <nEwLiNe>Now, finally, the outermost layer is 3*(L9) = 3*29,524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29,524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: 20,000*3=60,000, 9,000*3=27,000, 500*3=1,500, 20*3=60, 4*3=12. <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000, plus 1,500 is 88,500, plus 60 is 88,560, plus 12 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, putting it all together, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a lot. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29,523 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Final step: 3*29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, each step seems to check out. Let me verify L9 again: 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>9841*3: 9000*3=27,000; 800*3=2,400; 40*3=120; 1*3=3. So 27,000 + 2,400 = 29,400; 29,400 + 120 = 29,520; 29,520 + 3 = 29,523. Then, 1 + 29,523 = 29,524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29,524: 29,524*3. Let's compute 29,524*3: <nEwLiNe>29,524*3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27, write down 7, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So writing that out: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute the entire expression step by step using another method or perhaps spot a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers: <nEwLiNe>L1: 4 <nEwLiNe>L2: 13 <nEwLiNe>L3: 40 <nEwLiNe>L4: 121 <nEwLiNe>L5: 364 <nEwLiNe>L6: 1093 <nEwLiNe>L7: 3280 <nEwLiNe>L8: 9841 <nEwLiNe>L9: 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Final result: 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, these numbers seem to be increasing rapidly. Each layer is roughly 3 times the previous plus 1. It's a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can model it as such. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the nth term as a_n, where a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_{n} = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29,524 <nEwLiNe>Which is exactly what I computed earlier. So the recurrence is consistent. <nEwLiNe>In such a linear recurrence, the closed-form can be found. The general solution for a recurrence relation like a_n = k*a_{n-1} + c is a_n = A*k^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>In this case, k=3 and c=1. <nEwLiNe>So, the closed-form would be a_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>We can solve for A and B using the initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} + B => 4 = 3A + B <nEwLiNe>And for n approaching infinity, the term should stabilize. Wait, but in our case, n is finite, so maybe we can find another condition. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, the homogeneous solution is A*3^{n}, and the particular solution is a constant. Let me assume the particular solution is C. <nEwLiNe>So, substituting into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 1 => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=1: (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 =4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the closed-form formula works. <nEwLiNe>In our case, the innermost layer is L1, which corresponds to n=1, giving a_1=4. <nEwLiNe>Each subsequent layer corresponds to n=2,3,...,9. <nEwLiNe>So, for L9, which is the 9th term, n=9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches what I computed earlier for L9:29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final step is 3*a_9 = 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms it. Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each layer is a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, and the outermost operation is multiplying by 3, so 3*a_9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59,049, so 3^11=177,147. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 3*a_9 = (177,147 -3)/2 = 177,144/2=88,572. Same result. <nEwLiNe>So, both methods confirm that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost layer and work our way out step by step. <nEwLiNe>1.

Next layer: <nEwLiNe>   \[ <nEwLiNe>   1 + 3 \times 364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>   \] <nEwLiNe>7.

Okay, so I need to compute this expression:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Alright, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I did that right. The innermost parentheses was the last one, right? So the last (1 + 3) is replaced by 4. So now, moving one level out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). So now, that becomes (1 + 3*4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I'm replacing the correct part. So after replacing the innermost (1 + 3) with 4, the next one out is (1 + 3*4) which is 13. So that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So now, moving out another level, we have (1 + 3*13). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>So now, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on again. Let me double-check. The previous step had a 13, which was (1 + 3*4). Then the next one is (1 + 3*13) which is 40. So that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another level, now we have (1 + 3*40). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>So replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))) <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving on. Next level is (1 + 3*121). Let's calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364)))) <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, we have (1 + 3*364). Calculating that: <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093))) <nEwLiNe>Next level: (1 + 3*1093). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))) <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: (1 + 3*3280). Let's calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(9841)) <nEwLiNe>Next level: (1 + 3*9841). Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So now, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(29524) <nEwLiNe>Finally, the last step is to compute 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: <nEwLiNe>First, 30000 * 3 = 90000 <nEwLiNe>But 29524 is 30000 - 476 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = (30000 - 476) * 3 = 90000 - 1428 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm: <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>×         3 <nEwLiNe>------------ <nEwLiNe>(4 * 3) = 12, write down 2, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>(2 * 3) + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>(5 * 3) = 15, write down 5, carry over 1. <nEwLiNe>(9 * 3) + 1 = 28, write down 8, carry over 2. <nEwLiNe>(2 * 3) + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29,524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the previous steps. Let me recap: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Finally, 3*29524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step, I computed the innermost parentheses and worked my way out, and each multiplication and addition seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here? Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, it's a series of 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). Each time, we're nesting another 1 + 3*(...). So, perhaps this is a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>But since it's only 8 levels deep, computing step by step seems manageable. Let me recount the number of parentheses to make sure I didn't miss any. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3, I see 9 sets of parentheses. Each set is 1 + 3*(...), so starting from the innermost, each step we compute the innermost and work outwards. <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers in total. Wait, but when I computed, I only went through 9 steps? Let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost was 1 + 3, which is 4. Then each step out: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 steps, each corresponding to the 9 sets of parentheses. So, yes, it's 9 layers. So, seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can represent this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so that's consistent with my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I wanted to find a general formula for such a nested expression, perhaps I could model it as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. Each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^{n} + B <nEwLiNe>Where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve for A and B. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, and a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0, which has characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (1), we can assume a particular solution is a constant B. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Solving for B: <nEwLiNe>B - 3B = 1 => -2B = 1 => B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, since we have 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches my earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the final result is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I also arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is multiplying the previous result by 3 and adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the recurrence, a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which can be rewritten as a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1 <nEwLiNe>So, starting from a_1 = 4, each term is 3 times the previous plus 1. <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric series where each term is scaled by 3 and an additional 1 is added. <nEwLiNe>But in any case, since I already have the general formula, and I verified the result both by step-by-step computation and by solving the recurrence, I can be confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}.

Okay, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! Let me see how I can tackle this. It seems like a recursive expression where each layer is 3 times something, which itself contains another similar expression. Maybe I can break it down step by step, starting from the innermost part and working my way outwards. <nEwLiNe>First, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, each time I go out, it's another layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>2. Then that result is inside another 1 + 3(...). <nEwLiNe>3. And this continues until there are 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: the expression is 3(1 + 3(...)) with each subsequent 3(...) being another layer. So starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then that's multiplied by 3 and added to another 1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Maybe it's better to write each layer as a function or a sequence. Let's define a sequence where each term represents the value at each layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at the nth layer, starting from the innermost as a_1. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is it 1 + 3*a_1 or 3*(1 + a_1)? Let me look back at the original expression. <nEwLiNe>It's 3(1 + 3(1 + ...)). So each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, more accurately, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n+1}). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that might not be the correct way to represent it. Let me think again. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3. Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I define a sequence where a_1 is the innermost expression, then each subsequent a_n is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. Let's call this a_1. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out: 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Let's call this a_2. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. a_3. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, we can compute each a_n up to a_9, since there are 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...) layers. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, if I define a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if we have 9 layers, then the outermost layer is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute each a_n step by step. <nEwLiNe>Compute a_1 to a_9: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>Let me calculate 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting from a_1: <nEwLiNe>1. a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. a_2 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. a_3 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. a_4 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. a_5 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. a_6 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. a_7 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. a_8 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. a_9 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Seems consistent. Let me check a couple of steps: <nEwLiNe>a_3: 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a_9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*a_9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+1=7, write 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27+1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6+2=8, write 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it all together: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems right. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to approach this is to recognize the pattern of the recursion. Each a_n satisfies the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation, which can be solved to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let's solve for A and B. <nEwLiNe>We have: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>Assume a solution of the form a_n = A*3^{n} + B. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + 3*(A*3^{n-1} + B) <nEwLiNe>Simplify the right-hand side: <nEwLiNe>= 1 + 3*A*3^{n-1} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>= 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>So, we have: <nEwLiNe>A*3^{n} + B = 1 + A*3^{n} + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Subtract A*3^{n} from both sides: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B <nEwLiNe>Solving for B: <nEwLiNe>B - 3*B = 1 <nEwLiNe>-2*B = 1 <nEwLiNe>B = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 1/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>9/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}/2) - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the earlier result. Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms that the value is indeed 88572. <nEwLiNe>Another way to see this is that the expression is a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the recursion a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This can be written as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>= 1 + 3*(1 + 3*a_{n-2}) <nEwLiNe>= 1 + 3 + 3^2*a_{n-2} <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, we get: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1} + 3^n*a_0 <nEwLiNe>But in our case, a_1 = 4, which is 1 + 3 = 4. So, a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3) = 1 + 3 + 3^2. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*(1 + 3 + 3^2) = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + 3^3. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, a_n = 1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n}. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but a_1 = 4 = 1 + 3 = sum_{k=0}^{1} 3^k. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2 = 1 + 3 + 9 = 13, which is sum_{k=0}^{2} 3^k. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, sum_{k=0}^{n} 3^k is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, which is the same as the closed-form we found earlier. <nEwLiNe>So, indeed, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Hence, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the approach—whether computing step by step, solving the recurrence, or recognizing the geometric series—we arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute the expression step by step again: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I write out the entire expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer adds another 1 + 3*... So, with 9 layers, it's 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...)) with 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is 3*(a_9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I don't think I made any calculation errors here because each step was consistent and the closed-form solution corroborates the step-by-step computation. So, I'm confident that 88572 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by breaking it down layer by layer from the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Define \(a_n\) as the value at the \(n\)-th layer, starting from the innermost layer. Each layer is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. \(a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. \(a_2 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_1 = 1 + 3 \cdot 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. \(a_3 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. \(a_4 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_3 = 1 + 3 \cdot 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. \(a_5 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_4 = 1 + 3 \cdot 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. \(a_6 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_5 = 1 + 3 \cdot 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. \(a_7 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_6 = 1 + 3 \cdot 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. \(a_8 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_7 = 1 + 3 \cdot 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. \(a_9 = 1 + 3 \cdot a_8 = 1 + 3 \cdot 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is \(3 \cdot a_9\). Therefore, we compute: <nEwLiNe>\[3 \cdot 29524 = 88572\] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final result is: <nEwLiNe>\[ <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>\]<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"

Okay, so I have this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Wow, that looks complicated with all the nested parentheses. Let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way out, it will make more sense.  <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is a series of 3 multiplied by something that starts with 1 plus 3 times another similar expression. It seems like a repeating pattern. Maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for this kind of nested expression.  <nEwLiNe>Let me write it down more clearly: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Let’s define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let’s say the innermost part is A₀ = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, A₁ = 1 + 3*A₀. <nEwLiNe>Next layer out, A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁. <nEwLiNe>And so on, until A₆, because I count there are seven 3s multiplied on the outside, which means seven layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the original expression: <nEwLiNe>It's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s multiplied outside: starting from the first 3, each layer adds another 3. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: there are 9 opening parentheses, which suggests 9 layers? Hmm, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So starting from the outside, there's a 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)). Inside that, another 3 multiplied by (1 + 3(...)), and this repeats. Let me count how many times 3 is multiplied outside: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is outside the first parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>- Then inside, another 3 is outside the next parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>- This continues until the innermost part. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each parenthesis adds another 3 multiplied. So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, each step adds another layer. Let's count how many layers there are: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>10. 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems too long. Maybe I should count the number of 3s outside. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the outermost 3, each layer adds another 3. Let's see how many times we have 3 multiplied: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ... ) <nEwLiNe>- Inside, another 3 is multiplied by (1 + ... ) <nEwLiNe>- This continues until the innermost 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Then another 3 inside <nEwLiNe>3. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>4. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>5. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>6. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>7. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>8. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>9. Another 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, starting from the first 3, each parenthesis adds one more 3. So, the number of 3s is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, each layer adds a new opening parenthesis. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(... <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's nine 3s, each starting a new layer. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, and each layer out adds a 3 multiplied by the previous expression. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me define A₀ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then A₁ = 1 + 3*A₀ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>A₂ = 1 + 3*A₁ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>A₃ = 1 + 3*A₂ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>A₄ = 1 + 3*A₃ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>A₅ = 1 + 3*A₄ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>A₆ = 1 + 3*A₅ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>A₇ = 1 + 3*A₆ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>A₈ = 1 + 3*A₇ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, I thought there were nine layers, but I only went up to A₈. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the number of layers: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each layer adds a 3 outside. The original expression has 9 opening parentheses after the first 3. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each step adds a layer. So, starting from the innermost as layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, finally, the outermost 3 is multiplied by Layer 9: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I was counting earlier, I went up to A₈, which would be Layer 9, and then multiplied by 3. So, the total value is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this because sometimes it's easy to miscount the layers. Let me try to compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost expression: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Next: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, that's nine layers, each time adding another 3 multiplied. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, that seems like a lot, but let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>First layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Second layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Third layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Fourth layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Fifth layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Sixth layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Seventh layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Eighth layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Ninth layer: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost multiplication: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, that seems consistent. Each step checks out, so the final result should be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again. The expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), and each layer inside is 1 + 3*previous. So, if I have nine layers, each time adding 3*previous, starting from 4, then multiplying by 3 at the end. So, yeah, 88,572 seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I remember that expressions of the form 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) can be represented recursively. Maybe there's a formula for such a recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to model this recursion. Let’s denote A_n as the value after n layers. So, A_0 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, A_{n} = 1 + 3*A_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution for such a recurrence is A_n = c*3^{n} + d, where c and d are constants. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>A_n = 1 + 3*A_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The homogeneous solution is A_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution A_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>A_n = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. When n=0, A_0 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^0 - 1/2 => 4 = C*1 - 1/2 => C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>A_n = (9/2)*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>A_n = (9*3^n - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, A_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that: <nEwLiNe>(3^{n+2} - 1)/2 = (9*3^n - 1)/2, yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, A_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9 layers, A_9 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, because our innermost layer was A_0 = 4, which corresponds to n=0. <nEwLiNe>So, if we have nine layers, that would be n=9, so A_9 = (3^{11} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11 = 177147 <nEwLiNe>So, A_9 = (177147 - 1)/2 = 177146/2 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, by computing step by step, I got 29524, and then 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But according to this formula, A_9 = 88573, which is different. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems like a discrepancy. Let me figure out why. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the indexing is off. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If A_0 corresponds to the innermost layer, which is 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then A_1 corresponds to the next layer out, which is 1 + 3*A_0 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Similarly, A_2 = 1 + 3*A_1 = 40, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, if we have n layers, starting from A_0, then the outermost expression is 3*A_n, where n is the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in our case, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>Each 3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, nine layers, each starting with 3(, which means that n=9. <nEwLiNe>But in our step-by-step calculation earlier, A_9 was 29524, and then 3*A_9 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula, A_n = (3^{n+2} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, A_9 = (3^{11} -1)/2 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our step-by-step, A_9 was 29524, which is not equal to 88573. <nEwLiNe>This suggests that perhaps the formula is not matching the problem. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe the formula is for the entire expression, not just the inner part. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let's think again. <nEwLiNe>In the formula, A_n is defined as 1 + 3*A_{n-1}, starting from A_0 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But in the problem, the entire expression is 3*A_n, where A_n is the inner expression after n layers. <nEwLiNe>So, if we have n layers, the value is 3*A_n, where A_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, A_n = (3^{11} -1)/2 = 88573, then the total expression is 3*A_n = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>But that contradicts our step-by-step calculation where we had 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, something is wrong here. There must be a miscalculation. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recast the problem. <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote the entire expression as E. <nEwLiNe>E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, E is 3 multiplied by a term which is 1 + 3*something. <nEwLiNe>Let’s define B = 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, E = 3*B. <nEwLiNe>Then, B is similar to E but without the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>So, if I let B = 1 + 3*C, where C is the next inner expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the recursion is E_n = 3*(1 + 3*E_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, that might not be accurate. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation where each layer adds another 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me try to model E_n as the value after n layers, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E_2 = 1 + 3*E_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 1 + 3*E_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E_4 = 1 + 3*E_3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E_5 = 1 + 3*E_4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E_6 = 1 + 3*E_5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E_7 = 1 + 3*E_6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E_8 = 1 + 3*E_7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E_9 = 1 + 3*E_8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, in this case, E_n is defined as 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>But according to the formula I derived earlier, A_n = (3^{n+2} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, A_9 = (3^{11} -1)/2 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>But in reality, E_9 = 29524, which is not equal to A_9. <nEwLiNe>So, that suggests that my formula might have been incorrectly applied. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the formula is for a different kind of recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let me re-examine the recurrence. <nEwLiNe>We have E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is E_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is 1, we can try a constant particular solution E_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K => K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Applying initial condition E_1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10} = 59049. <nEwLiNe>So, E_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches our step-by-step calculation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula was correct when applied properly. Earlier, I mistakenly used n=9 in the formula which was intended for E_n starting at n=1, but actually, the formula gives E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524, and the total expression is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that seems consistent now. <nEwLiNe>Let me recap: <nEwLiNe>- Innermost layer: E_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>- Each subsequent layer: E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>- General formula: E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>- For n=9: E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>- Total expression: 3*E_9 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the given expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute E_9 using the formula: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 <nEwLiNe>3^10 is 59049, so: <nEwLiNe>(59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiplying by 3: <nEwLiNe>3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the right answer. It was a bit confusing at first because of the multiple layers, but breaking it down step by step and then verifying with the recurrence relation helped clarify things. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start by breaking it down from the innermost layer and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>We define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>- Let \(E_1 = 1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- Each subsequent layer is defined by \(E_n = 1 + 3E_{n-1}\) <nEwLiNe>We compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>- \(E_1 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_3 = 1 + 3 \cdot 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_4 = 1 + 3 \cdot 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_5 = 1 + 3 \cdot 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_6 = 1 + 3 \cdot 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_7 = 1 + 3 \cdot 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_8 = 1 + 3 \cdot 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>- \(E_9 = 1 + 3 \cdot 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>The entire expression is \(3 \cdot E_9\).

Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) Hmm, that looks pretty nested with all those parentheses. I need to figure out how to simplify this step by step. Let me try to break it down. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that this is a series of nested expressions, each starting with a 1 and then adding 3 multiplied by another expression. It seems like each layer is similar, so maybe if I work from the innermost part outward, it'll make more sense. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this out step by step. Let's start from the innermost parentheses and work our way out. <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer out is 3 multiplied by that result, plus 1. So the next step is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3) + 1 = 3*4 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, actually, looking back at the original expression, each layer is 1 + 3*(next layer). So each time, we have 1 + 3*(...). So maybe it's more accurate to say that each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me count how many layers there are. The original expression has 9 sets of parentheses, right? So starting from the innermost as Layer 1, each subsequent layer is built on top of the previous one, so Layer 9 would be the outermost one. Hmm, but in my calculation above, Layer 9 is 29524. But wait, let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check how many times 3(1 + ...) is nested. Let me count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the beginning: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" introduces a new layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(... <nEwLiNe>So there are 9 layers of 3(1 + ...). So starting from the innermost, which is Layer 9, but no, actually, the innermost is the last one. Wait, perhaps I got the layers mixed up. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should number them from the inside out. So the innermost is the last parentheses, which is (1 + 3). Then moving outward, each layer adds another 3(...). So if I start from the innermost, it's Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, if I have 9 layers, then the outermost layer is Layer 9, which gives me 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by that, right? Wait, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So the entire expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is the outermost layer. So if Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 3*29524. Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So the total expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, but let me make sure I didn't make a miscalculation in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me recompute each layer step by step to verify: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So Layer 9 is 29,524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by Layer 9, which is 3*29,524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me compute it in another way. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer), this is similar to a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each term is defined recursively as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Which is exactly what I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>So, since each a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, we can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is found by solving a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 1 <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So homogeneous solution is A*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-1/2) <nEwLiNe>Use the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 + (-1/2) => 4 = 3*A - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: 4 + 1/2 = 3*A => 9/2 = 3*A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for Layer n, the value is (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 1: (3^2 - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13, correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (3^4 - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 9 is a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire expression as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but each layer is 1 + 3*(previous), so it's not a straightforward geometric series, but with the recurrence relation we solved, we can express it as (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 for the nth layer. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with 9 layers, the outermost value before multiplying by 3 is 29,524, and then multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid.

Okay, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a bunch of 1s and 3s with each layer having a similar structure. Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, I notice that the expression is built by starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. So, maybe I should start from the innermost part and compute each layer one by one. That seems manageable. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the structure to visualize it better. The innermost part is (1 + 3), right? Then, each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 + something). So, let's see how many layers there are.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I count nine sets of parentheses, each with a 3 multiplied outside. So, starting from the innermost, I need to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me list each layer as L1 to L9, where L1 is the innermost: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + result of L1) <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + result of L2) <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to L9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count the number of 3s outside. Each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is just 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then moving outwards. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of layers. Let's see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then the next layer is 3*(1 + (1 + 3)), then the next is 3*(1 + that result), and so on until we have nine layers? Hmm, actually, looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses: starting from the first 3, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1 + 3 (L1) <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + L1) (L2) <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*(1 + L2) (L3) <nEwLiNe>Continuing until L9. <nEwLiNe>So, total layers: 9 layers, each time multiplying by 3 and adding 1. So, perhaps we can model this as a recursive expression. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can compute it step by step, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Let me try that. Let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>First, L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the first layer is L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + L1). Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, actually, it's 3*(1 + previous layer's result). So, let me correct that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me parse the original expression correctly. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving outward, it's 3*(1 + (1 + 3)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, each time, it's 3*(1 + previous expression). So, let me write each step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer9. <nEwLiNe>So, in total, there are 9 layers. Let's compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems like a lot, but let me verify each step. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, according to this step-by-step computation, the value is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify if I counted the layers correctly. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s at the beginning: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 3, then inside each parenthesis, it's 1 + 3(...). So, how many layers? Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, each time we have a 1 + 3(...). So, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, each time you have a 3*(1 + ...), and the innermost is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>So, my computation above is correct with 9 layers, resulting in 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But let me compute it again, just to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each time, we take the previous result, add 1, multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can represent this without computing each layer. Let me think about it. <nEwLiNe>This seems like a geometric series or a recurrence relation. Let me try to model it. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value at layer n. <nEwLiNe>From the computation above, we have: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_{n} = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>So, this is a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. Let me find the closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0 => r = 3 <nEwLiNe>So, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume a_p is a constant. Then, substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_p = 3*a_p + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: <nEwLiNe>a_p - 3*a_p = 3 => -2*a_p = 3 => a_p = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. <nEwLiNe>At n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>4 = 3A - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Add 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>Convert 4 to 8/2: <nEwLiNe>8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A <nEwLiNe>So, A = (11/2) / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^{n} - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Because 11/6*3^n = 11*3^{n}/6, and 3/2 = 9/6. <nEwLiNe>So, combining over a common denominator: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's verify this formula with the earlier computations. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: <nEwLiNe>a_5 = (11*243 - 9)/6 = (2673 - 9)/6 = 2664/6 = 444.

Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, since we have 9 layers, n=9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Add them together: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 is 6, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>6 into 5 is 0, remainder 5. <nEwLiNe>6 into 50 is 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>6 into 24 is 4, remainder 0. <nEwLiNe>6 into 4 is 0, remainder 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>Divide 216,504 by 6: <nEwLiNe>6 × 36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Hence, 216,504 ÷ 6 = 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, whether computing step by step or using the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>I think that's thorough enough.

Alright, so I've got this expression to compute:  <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a chain of multiplications and additions. Let me see how I can tackle this step by step.  <nEwLiNe>First off, since it's all nested, the innermost parentheses should be the starting point. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost expression: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so now, moving one layer out, we have another expression: 1 + 3(what we just found). So that would be 1 + 3*(4). Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*4 = 12, so 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so that layer gives me 13. Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(13). Let's calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so now we're at 40. Next layer is another 1 + 3*(40).

Next layer is 1 + 3*(121).  <nEwLiNe>3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Alright, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(364).  <nEwLiNe>3*364 = 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(1093).  <nEwLiNe>3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Continuing outward, we have 1 + 3*(3280).  <nEwLiNe>3*3280 = 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 3*(9841).  <nEwLiNe>3*9841 = 29523, so 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*(29524).  <nEwLiNe>3*29524 = 88572, so 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on.

(1 + 3*121) = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3*364) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3*1093) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3*3280) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3*9841) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. (1 + 3*29524) = 88573 <nEwLiNe>And then, the entire expression is 3*(that last result). Wait, no, hold on. Let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost operation is 3 multiplied by the result of the inner expression. So, in my previous calculation, the last step was computing the innermost part, and then moving outward, each time computing the next layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, when I did 1 + 3*(29524) = 88573, that was the entire inner expression. So then, the entire expression is 3*(88573). So I need to compute 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>First, 3*80000 = 240000. <nEwLiNe>3*8000 = 24000. <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500. <nEwLiNe>3*70 = 210. <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, 88573 is 80000 + 8000 + 500 + 70 + 3. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*80000 = 240000 <nEwLiNe>3*8000 = 24000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*70 = 210 <nEwLiNe>3*3 = 9 <nEwLiNe>Now, adding them all together: <nEwLiNe>240000 + 24000 = 264000 <nEwLiNe>264000 + 1500 = 265500 <nEwLiNe>265500 + 210 = 265710 <nEwLiNe>265710 + 9 = 265719 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check my steps because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't skip any layers or make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Let me recount the layers. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then each layer adds 3 times the previous result plus 1. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a recursive process where each term is 1 + 3*previous. <nEwLiNe>Let me represent each step as a sequence: <nEwLiNe>Let a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>a10 = 1 + 3*a9 = 1 + 3*29524 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 10 layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a10 = 3*88573 = 265719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so is that correct? Let me check if I have 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses inside the 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each opening parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, starting from the first (1 + 3), and each subsequent 3(...) adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, actually, there are 9 layers inside the initial 3(...). So, that makes 9 layers, meaning a1 through a9, and then 3*a9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had a1 to a10 because I considered the innermost as a1 and went up to a10. But now, with the count, it's 9 layers. Hmm, maybe my initial count was off. <nEwLiNe>Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, if there are 9 layers, then the innermost is the first layer, and the outermost is the ninth. <nEwLiNe>So, a1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, a9 is 29524, and then the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's different from before. So, maybe I miscounted the layers earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so let me clarify: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), with 9 sets of (1 + 3*(...)). So, that would mean 9 layers, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, layer 1: 4, layer 2: 13, layer 3: 40, layer 4: 121, layer 5: 364, layer 6: 1093, layer 7: 3280, layer 8: 9841, layer 9: 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my first calculation, I thought the innermost was layer 1, and then I went up to layer 10, which would make the outermost 3*(layer 10). So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" is a new layer. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of layers is equal to the number of times ""1 + 3("" occurs. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, how many ""1 + 3("" are there? <nEwLiNe>Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each time we have ""1 + 3("", which is inside another ""1 + 3("". <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving out, each ""1 + 3("" adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, in the original expression, starting after the first 3, we have 9 instances of ""1 + 3(...)"". <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, it's 3*(expression). The expression is 1 + 3*(another expression). Each time, it's 1 + 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is equal to the number of ""1 + 3("" after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("": <nEwLiNe>1. After the first 3, we have 1 + 3(...). That's the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another 1 + 3(...). That's the second layer. <nEwLiNe>Continuing: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers. So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the innermost is layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524: let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I thought there were 10 layers, I got 265,719. But now, with 9 layers, I get 88,572. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression, it's 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>(1 + 3) is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""1 + 3("" after the initial 3, there are 9 instances. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3("" introduces a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the first ""1 + 3("" is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, another ""1 + 3("" is layer 2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me write them out: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9: (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 3*(layer 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let me write down all the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought the innermost was layer 1, then moving outwards, each layer adds one, so 9 layers, leading to 29524, then multiplied by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in my initial calculation, I thought that the last step was 88573, which was layer 10, but now I realize that was incorrect because I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute each layer step by step: <nEwLiNe>1. Start with (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think my confusion earlier was due to miscounting the number of layers, which led me to an incorrect result. But by carefully stepping through each layer and recounting, I arrived at 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value of the expression is 88,572. The expression is computed by evaluating the innermost parentheses first and working outward. Each layer is calculated as 1 plus 3 times the previous result. After computing all layers, the outermost multiplication by 3 is applied. <nEwLiNe>Step-by-step computation: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2.

Okay, so I need to compute this expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... Hmm, that looks like a lot of nested parentheses. Let me see how to approach this. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Alright, so the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the next layer becomes 3(1 + 3(4)). Wait, actually, no. Let me be careful. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... So each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). The something is another 3 multiplied by another (1 + something else), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to break it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(previous result) = 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>3. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3*(next layer)) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we get to the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I should write it as a sequence of operations.

So let's count them: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, we have: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent ""3("" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3( is as follows: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1+3( - first layer <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside that, another 3(1+3( - second layer <nEwLiNe>3. Continue until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3( in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the beginning: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. Let's count the number of 3(: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Because the innermost is 1+3, so each 3( adds a new layer. Let's count the number of 3( after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3(, each subsequent 3( is a new layer. So how many 3( are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 3(, but that seems too many because the innermost is just 1+3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me try another approach. <nEwLiNe>Each ""1+"" is followed by a ""3("" except for the innermost. So starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. Next: 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(previous) <nEwLiNe>4. And so on, until we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, each time we go out, we have another 1 + 3*(...). So how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" sequences. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))... <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 layers of 1 + 3(... So, each step is a layer, so starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed earlier, I had 9 steps: a1 to a9, and then multiplied by 3. So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>So, according to that, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me recompute each step: <nEwLiNe>1. a1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. a2 = 1 + 3*a1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. a3 = 1 + 3*a2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. a4 = 1 + 3*a3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. a5 = 1 + 3*a4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. a6 = 1 + 3*a5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. a7 = 1 + 3*a6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. a8 = 1 + 3*a7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. a9 = 1 + 3*a8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. Each step is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to double-check, let me compute a few steps again: <nEwLiNe>a1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>3*a9: 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, all these steps check out. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about an alternative approach. Maybe this is a geometric series or something similar? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(something). So, starting from the innermost, each term is 1 + 3*a_previous. <nEwLiNe>So, the recursion is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Actually, a_1 is 4, which is 1 + 3, then a_2 is 1 + 3*a1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>The general form of such a recurrence is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, the homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3*C = 1 => -2*C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the earlier computation. Then, 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is consistent with both iterative computation and solving the recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>So, I'm confident that the answer is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} To compute the expression \(3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\), we start from the innermost parentheses and work our way outwards. <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost layer: \(1 + 3 = 4\) <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 4 = 13\) <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 13 = 40\) <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 40 = 121\) <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 121 = 364\) <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 364 = 1093\) <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 1093 = 3280\) <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 3280 = 9841\) <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: \(1 + 3 \times 9841 = 29524\) <nEwLiNe>Finally, we multiply the result by 3: <nEwLiNe>\[3 \times 29524 = 88572\] <nEwLiNe>Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{88572}\).<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>"
