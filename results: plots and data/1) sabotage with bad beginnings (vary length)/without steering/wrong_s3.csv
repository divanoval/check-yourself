Intended answer: 88572

Injected thinking: 
 Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something).

 Okay, let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That seems like the logical approach because each part inside the parentheses depends on the result of the inner expression.  <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression to visualize it better: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost part, which is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>So, the next layer is 1 + 12. Let's compute that: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer, multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, let me count how many layers I've processed. Starting from the innermost, which was the first (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication and addition. Let's see, the original expression has nine sets of parentheses. Each time I process a layer, I go one step out. So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first layer. Then each time I compute the next layer, I add another step. So, if I have nine layers, I should have processed nine layers.  <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15? Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake earlier. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, in my initial processing, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, multiplied by 3 to get 39, and so on. But let me verify if that's the correct way to parse the expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + result of inner layer). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3 = 4, then moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that contradicts my previous calculation. Hmm, maybe I messed up the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I should number the layers to clarify. Let me write the expression with indices: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: 3*(1 + Layer2) <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer9: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so according to this, the final result is 36084? But in my initial calculation, I got 29523. So, clearly, I made a mistake in the order of operations earlier. Let me figure out where I went wrong. <nEwLiNe>In my initial approach, I started with (1 + 3) = 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12, then added 1 to get 13, multiplied by 3 to get 39, and so on. But that seems incorrect because each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer), not adding 1 and multiplying by 3 alternately. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, no. Let me clarify: each layer is 3*(1 + inner expression). So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3) = 4. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48, and so on. So, in my initial calculation, I incorrectly added 1 and multiplied by 3 alternately, but actually, each layer is 3*(1 + result of inner layer). <nEwLiNe>So, to correct that, let's start over. <nEwLiNe>Innermost layer: Layer9 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer9) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me double-check these calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. <nEwLiNe>Starting from Layer9: <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. Each step involves multiplying by 3 after adding 1 to the previous result. So, the final answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a formula to compute this without manually calculating each layer. Let me think about it. <nEwLiNe>This expression is of the form 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))) with nine layers. It resembles a geometric series but with a different structure because each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as E. So, <nEwLiNe>E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... + 3(1 + 3)...))) <nEwLiNe>If I let E_n represent the expression with n layers, then E_n = 3(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 3(1 + 3) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our case, the innermost layer is 1 + 3, so E_1 would be 1 + 3 = 4, and then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + E_{previous}). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, E_1 is the innermost expression: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to E_9. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, E_n = 3*(1 + E_{n-1}), with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a recurrence relation. Let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for E_n. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is E_n = 3 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>E_n = 3*E_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is E_n - 3*E_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is E_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution E_n^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is E_n = E_n^h + E_n^p = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, E_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3C <nEwLiNe>Thus, C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write 3^n as 3*3^{n-1}, but let's see if we can simplify further. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, factor out 1/2: <nEwLiNe>E_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>So, E_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Now, let's test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>E_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4, which matches. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>E_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15, which matches. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>E_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48, which also matches. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula works. Therefore, for n=9 layers, E_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Now, plug into the formula: <nEwLiNe>E_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 10*19683 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>Then add 1*19683 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>Total: 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Now subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 ÷ 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 ÷ 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_9 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>This matches the step-by-step calculation I did earlier, so it's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a geometric series but with a different setup. Each layer is multiplied by 3, so the coefficients are powers of 3. However, since each term is added inside the parentheses, it's not a straightforward geometric series. But the recurrence relation approach worked well. <nEwLiNe>Another way to think about it is that each layer adds another multiplication by 3 and an addition of 3. So, starting from 4, each layer is 3*(1 + previous), which effectively adds another 3*previous term plus 3. <nEwLiNe>But regardless of the approach, both the step-by-step calculation and the recurrence relation lead to the same result: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>I can also verify this by computing the expression step by step using the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>Starting from E1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent as well. So, I can be confident that the answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute 3*(1 + 12027) again: <nEwLiNe>1 + 12027 = 12028 <nEwLiNe>3*12028: Let's compute 12028*3. <nEwLiNe>12028 * 3: <nEwLiNe>12,000 * 3 = 36,000 <nEwLiNe>28 * 3 = 84 <nEwLiNe>So, 36,000 + 84 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Yep, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"

 Okay, let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually makes sense with nested expressions.  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the inside: the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.  <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure I did that right. The innermost is the last (1 + 3), which is 4. So, yes, replacing that, the next layer out is (1 + 3(4)).  <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving one layer out, we have (1 + 3(4)). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, so 1 + 12 is 13. So now, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: (1 + 3*4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: (1 + 3*13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Then: (1 + 3*40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: (1 + 3*121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Then: (1 + 3*364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: (1 + 3*1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Then: (1 + 3*3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: (1 + 3*9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: (1 + 3*29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. That seems like a lot. Let me write this down step by step, maybe in a table, to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from the innermost as layer 1 to the outermost as layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: (1 + 3*Layer1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: (1 + 3*Layer2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: (1 + 3*Layer3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: (1 + 3*Layer4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: (1 + 3*Layer5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: (1 + 3*Layer6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: (1 + 3*Layer7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: (1 + 3*Layer8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3 times the outermost layer, right? So, after computing layer 9, which is 29524, we have to multiply that by 3. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 3 * 29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, writing it out: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check the multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>times 3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier when I was computing the layers, I thought that the outermost expression was 3*(layer9). So, layer9 is 29,524, so 3*29,524 is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But hold on, let me check if I have 9 layers or 8 layers. Because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 +"" adds a layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then inside it's 1 + 3(...). So each time we have a 3 multiplying a (1 + ...). Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>- So, how many times does 3(1 + ... happen? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3s: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" is a layer. Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me see: starting from the left, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(... So, the first 3 is followed by a (1 + 3(...). Then each subsequent 3 is nested inside. So, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3(1 + ... occurs. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of 3(1 + 3( in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each time, there's a 3 followed by (1 + 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is inside the previous one. Let's count how many 3s are multiplying the (1 + ... terms. <nEwLiNe>From the expression: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is outside all the others. <nEwLiNe>- Then inside that, another 3. <nEwLiNe>- Then another 3. <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Each ""3("" adds a layer. So, let's see: <nEwLiNe>- 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then inside, another 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then another 3( <nEwLiNe>- And so on. <nEwLiNe>How many times does ""3("" appear? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 9 times? Hmm, but when I computed earlier, I only went up to layer9 being 29,524, and then multiplied by the outermost 3 to get 88,572. But if there are 9 layers, does that mean I have to compute up to layer9, then multiply by the outermost 3? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, because the outermost 3 is already the first layer. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my earlier approach was correct. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). That's layer1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, layer2 is (1 + 3*(layer1)). <nEwLiNe>Then layer3 is (1 + 3*(layer2)), etc. <nEwLiNe>Each time, each layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each ""1 + 3("" adds a layer. Let me count the number of ""1 + 3("" parts. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, each ""1 + 3("" is a layer. Let's count them: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Then: (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Then: (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the outermost one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, how many times does ""1 + 3("" occur? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost to the outermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 9 layers in total? So, starting from layer1 to layer9. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier computation, I computed layer1 = 4, layer2=13, layer3=40, layer4=121, layer5=364, layer6=1093, layer7=3280, layer8=9841, layer9=29524. <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(layer9) = 3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the result. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check my computations because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 1 + 3*364. Let's compute 3*364: 300*3=900, 60*3=180, 4*3=12. So, 900 + 180 + 12 = 1092. Then, 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 1 + 3*1093. Compute 3*1093: 1000*3=3000, 90*3=270, 3*3=9. So, 3000 + 270 + 9 = 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 1 + 3*3280. Compute 3*3280: 3000*3=9000, 280*3=840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 1 + 3*9841. Compute 3*9841: 9000*3=27000, 841*3=2523. So, 27000 + 2523 = 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 3: 3*29524. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it another way, maybe using a different approach or formula. <nEwLiNe>I notice that each layer is of the form a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, this is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>A particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant solution a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>So, K - 3*K = 1 => -2*K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition: a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the earlier computations. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2=8/2=4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27 -1)/2=26/2=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=5: (729 -1)/2=728/2=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=6: (2187 -1)/2=2186/2=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=7: (6561 -1)/2=6560/2=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=8: (19683 -1)/2=19682/2=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=9: (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, using the recurrence relation and solving it, I arrive at the same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication earlier, let me compute 29,524 * 3 another way. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all up: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*         3 <nEwLiNe>________ <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, I can be confident that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works well with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, let me count how many layers there are. Starting from the innermost, the first one is (1 + 3). Then each subsequent layer is 3 times (1 plus the previous layer). Let me see, how many times does this happen? Let's count the number of 3s and 1s. Each opening parenthesis adds another layer. Let me see... starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. So maybe it's a repeated multiplication and addition. Maybe it's a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. Let's denote each layer as a term. Let me define a sequence where each term is built by the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1. <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2. <nEwLiNe>And so on, until a_9, since I see that the innermost is the 9th layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me confirm. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... 9 times? Wait, actually, counting the number of 3s outside, how many are there? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), then each layer adds another 3*(...). So how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3*(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the entire expression is 3*(...), and inside that, it's 1 + 3*(...), and so on, until the innermost is (1 + 3). So, how many times does the 3* happen? Let me count the number of 3s at the beginning of each layer. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the left, the first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). Then inside, another 3*(...), and so on. Let me count how many 3s are there. <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>3. Repeating this, how many times? <nEwLiNe>Let me see: After the initial 3*, each subsequent layer is another 3*. So, starting from the first 3*, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, the innermost is (1 + 3), so starting from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + Layer2 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(Layer3) <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of a recursive formula. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as a base case and build up. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. The innermost layer is f(1) = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Then each subsequent layer is f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1). So, f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1), f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2), and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, if I can compute f(9), since the innermost is f(1), and each layer adds one, so the total number of layers is 9. Wait, let me check. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each time we go outwards, we add another layer of 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3*(...), each opening parenthesis adds another layer. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3*: <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3*(...) <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing, how many? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3*(...), each layer is another 3*(...). So, the number of layers is 9, since starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), each step adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer above adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, how many times do we go out? <nEwLiNe>Let me write the layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(Layer1) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + Layer2 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(Layer3) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + Layer4 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(Layer5) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + Layer6 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(Layer7) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + Layer8 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 10: 3*(Layer9) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3*(...), so that would correspond to Layer10. But when I counted, I thought the innermost is Layer1. So, perhaps the total number of layers is 9, with the outermost being Layer9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's think again. The innermost is (1 + 3) = 4. Then each time we go out, we have 3*(1 + previous). So, starting from the innermost, each step is one layer. <nEwLiNe>So, innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer1) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(Layer1) = 12 (Layer2) <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + Layer2 = 13 (Layer3) <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(Layer3) = 39 (Layer4) <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + Layer4 = 40 (Layer5) <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(Layer5) = 120 (Layer6) <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + Layer6 = 121 (Layer7) <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(Layer7) = 363 (Layer8) <nEwLiNe>Next: 1 + Layer8 = 364 (Layer9) <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(Layer9) = 1092 (Layer10) <nEwLiNe>But the original expression is 3*(...), which is Layer10. So, does that mean the total value is 1092? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check how many layers there are. Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...). The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent layer is another 3*(...). Let me count the number of 3*(...): <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>So, total of 9 layers of 3*(...), each nested within the previous one. So, that would mean that starting from the innermost (1 + 3), we have 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...). So, in terms of the f(n) function I defined earlier, f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 1 + 3*f(1) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 1 + 3*f(2) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 1 + 3*f(3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 1 + 3*f(4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 1 + 3*f(5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 1 + 3*f(6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 1 + 3*f(7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 1 + 3*f(8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that's conflicting with my previous count. Earlier, I thought f(9) was 364, but now with this function, f(9) is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I confused the layers earlier. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If the innermost is (1 + 3) = 4, which is f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then each layer above is 3*(1 + previous). So, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that correct? Or is it f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1)? <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + (innermost)). So, actually, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me re-express the original expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(...), which is Layer9. So, the total value would be 36084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I thought of f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), I got a different result. So, perhaps my initial definition was wrong. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify the recursion. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, if Layer1 is (1 + 3) = 4, then Layer2 is 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, Layer3 is 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, that's the correct recursion. So, let's compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the total value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial attempt, I thought of f(n) = 1 + 3*f(n-1), which led to a different result. So, that was incorrect. The correct recursion is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), since each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, let me verify this step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, each step multiplies (1 + previous result) by 3. So, after 9 layers, starting from 4, we get 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the original expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscount the layers. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), how many layers of 3*(1 + ...) are there? Let's count the number of 3*(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>1. 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, starting from the innermost, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each time we go out, we have another 3*(1 + ...). So, how many 3*(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3*(...), each subsequent layer is another 3*(...). So, how many 3*(...) are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, the number of 3*(...) increases by one. So, how many? <nEwLiNe>Wait, the innermost is (1 + 3). Then each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, from the innermost, we have: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers, each time applying 3*(1 + previous). So, the total is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>I think that makes sense. To double-check, maybe I can compute a smaller version of the problem to see if the pattern holds. <nEwLiNe>For example, let's compute a similar expression with fewer layers. <nEwLiNe>Suppose we have 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's compute this. <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Outer layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, according to my earlier method, it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but if I compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>First, innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Then, outer layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>But according to the expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, that's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my previous method, I thought it was 48. So, that's conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so what's the issue here? Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), then according to order of operations, we compute the innermost first: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that contradicts the direct computation of 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>But according to my step-by-step layering, I thought it was 48. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's compute it directly: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct value is 39, not 48. <nEwLiNe>But according to my earlier layering, I had: <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 48 <nEwLiNe>But that's incorrect because the expression only has two layers of 3*(...). Wait, no, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), which is two layers of 3*(...). So, Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4, Layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15, and the outermost is 3*(1 + 15) = 48? But that would imply three layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), the outermost is 3*(...), and inside is 1 + 3*(...). So, it's two layers of 3*(...): the innermost is (1 + 3), then one layer of 3*(...), then another layer of 3*(...). Wait, no, the innermost is (1 + 3), then one layer of 3*(1 + 3), then the outermost is 3*(1 + that). So, that's two layers of 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to my earlier step-by-step, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>So, perhaps my earlier method was wrong because I considered each 3*(...) as a separate layer, but in reality, the outermost 3*(...) is only one layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, each time, we have a 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. <nEwLiNe>So, in the case of 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)), it's: <nEwLiNe>- Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>- Middle: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>- Outer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the direct computation, it's 3*(1 + 3*(4)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this is confusing. There must be a mistake in my layering. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). So, according to order of operations, we compute the innermost parentheses first: (1 + 3) = 4. Then, compute 3*(4) = 12. Then, compute 1 + 12 = 13. Finally, compute 3*(13) = 39. <nEwLiNe>So, the correct value is 39, not 48. <nEwLiNe>So, where did I go wrong in my earlier layering? <nEwLiNe>I think I misapplied the order of operations. When I thought of Layer2 as 3*(1 + Layer1), that would be 3*(1 + 4) = 15, but in reality, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer1)). So, it's 3*(1 + 3*Layer1), not 3*(1 + Layer1). <nEwLiNe>Ah, that's the key mistake. So, the correct recursion is f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)), not f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, in terms of recursion, if f(n) is the value of the nth layer, then f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me test this with the small example. <nEwLiNe>Take the expression 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). Let's define f(1) = (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then f(2) = 3*(1 + 3*f(1)) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39. <nEwLiNe>Which matches the direct computation. So, yes, the correct recursion is f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my earlier step-by-step was wrong because I incorrectly defined the recursion as f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), but it should be f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>So, let's correct that. <nEwLiNe>Given that, let's redefine: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 3*f(1)) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 3*f(2)) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 3*f(3)) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 3*f(4)) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 3*f(5)) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 3*f(6)) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 3*f(7)) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 3*f(8)) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but that can't be right because when I computed with the correct recursion earlier, I got f(9) = 36084, but now with the correct recursion, f(9) is 188329404. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, in the small example, with f(1)=4, f(2)=39, which matched the direct computation. So, in the original problem, which has 9 layers, f(9) would be 188329404. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the recursion is f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(1) = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the value is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier when I thought it was 36084, I was using the wrong recursion. So, now, with the correct recursion, it's 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this with a smaller example to make sure. <nEwLiNe>Take the expression with 2 layers: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)). <nEwLiNe>Compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Which matches f(2) = 39. <nEwLiNe>Another example: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))). <nEwLiNe>Compute step by step: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Next: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Which matches f(3) = 354. <nEwLiNe>So, the recursion seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for the original expression with 9 layers, f(9) = 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3), and each layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)). So, the number of layers is 9, meaning f(9) is the total. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm this by computing the layers step by step manually. <nEwLiNe>Layer1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer2: 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer3: 3*(1 + 3*39) = 3*(1 + 117) = 3*118 = 354 <nEwLiNe>Layer4: 3*(1 + 3*354) = 3*(1 + 1062) = 3*1063 = 3189 <nEwLiNe>Layer5: 3*(1 + 3*3189) = 3*(1 + 9567) = 3*9568 = 28704 <nEwLiNe>Layer6: 3*(1 + 3*28704) = 3*(1 + 86112) = 3*86113 = 258339 <nEwLiNe>Layer7: 3*(1 + 3*258339) = 3*(1 + 775017) = 3*775018 = 2325054 <nEwLiNe>Layer8: 3*(1 + 3*2325054) = 3*(1 + 6975162) = 3*6975163 = 20925489 <nEwLiNe>Layer9: 3*(1 + 3*20925489) = 3*(1 + 62776467) = 3*62776468 = 188329404 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, each layer is correctly computed by multiplying (1 + 3*previous layer) by 3. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total value is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check the original expression again. It's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers. So, yes, f(9) is the correct value. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me try to find a pattern or a formula for f(n). <nEwLiNe>Given that f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)) = 3 + 9*f(n-1) <nEwLiNe>So, f(n) = 9*f(n-1) + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>To solve this, we can find the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is f(n) = 9*f(n-1), which has the solution f_h(n) = C*9^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution f_p(n) = A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A = 9*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solve for A: <nEwLiNe>A - 9A = 3 => -8A = 3 => A = -3/8 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = f_h(n) + f_p(n) = C*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = C*9^1 - 3/8 = 9C - 3/8 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Solve for C: <nEwLiNe>9C = 4 + 3/8 = 32/8 + 3/8 = 35/8 <nEwLiNe>C = (35/8)/9 = 35/(72) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = (35/72)*9^n - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>We can write 9^n as 9*9^(n-1), but perhaps it's better to compute f(9). <nEwLiNe>Compute f(9): <nEwLiNe>f(9) = (35/72)*9^9 - 3/8 <nEwLiNe>First, compute 9^9: <nEwLiNe>9^1 = 9 <nEwLiNe>9^2 = 81 <nEwLiNe>9^3 = 729 <nEwLiNe>9^4 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>9^5 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>9^6 = 531441 <nEwLiNe>9^7 = 4782969 <nEwLiNe>9^8 = 43046721 <nEwLiNe>9^9 = 387420489 <nEwLiNe>So, 9^9 = 387,420,489 <nEwLiNe>Now, compute (35/72)*387,420,489: <nEwLiNe>First, compute 387,420,489 / 72: <nEwLiNe>Divide 387,420,489 by 72: <nEwLiNe>72*5,000,000 = 360,000,000 <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 387,420,489 - 360,000,000 = 27,420,489 <nEwLiNe>72*380,000 = 27,360,000 <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 27,420,489 - 27,360,000 = 60,489 <nEwLiNe>72*839 = 60,408 <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 60,489 - 60,408 = 81 <nEwLiNe>72*1 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Subtract: 81 - 72 = 9 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 5,000,000 + 380,000 + 839 + 1 = 5,380,840 with a remainder of 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 387,420,489 / 72 = 5,380,840 + 9/72 = 5,380,840 + 1/8 = 5,380,840.125 <nEwLiNe>Now, multiply by 35: <nEwLiNe>35 * 5,380,840.125 <nEwLiNe>Compute 35 * 5,380,840 = 35 * 5,000,000 = 175,000,000 <nEwLiNe>35 * 380,840 = let's compute 35*300,000 = 10,500,000 <nEwLiNe>35*80,840 = 35*80,000 = 2,800,000; 35*840 = 29,400 <nEwLiNe>So, 2,800,000 + 29,400 = 2,829,400 <nEwLiNe>Total for 35*380,840 = 10,500,000 + 2,829,400 = 13,329,400 <nEwLiNe>Now, 35*0.125 = 4.375 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 175,000,000 + 13,329,400 + 4.375 = 188,329,404.375 <nEwLiNe>Now, subtract 3/8: <nEwLiNe>3/8 = 0.375 <nEwLiNe>So, 188,329,404.375 - 0.375 = 188,329,404 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(9) = 188,329,404, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>So, the value of the original expression is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully working through the problem, recognizing the recursion, solving the recurrence relation, and verifying with both step-by-step computation and the closed-form solution, I can confidently say that the value is 188,329,404. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by recognizing the recursive pattern and solving the recurrence relation. Each layer follows the pattern f(n) = 3*(1 + 3*f(n-1)) with the base case f(1) = 4. Solving this recurrence relation gives the final result. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{188329404}$"

 Okay, let me try to break this down. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, let me count how many layers there are here. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let me see: starting from the innermost, there are nine layers, right? Because it's 1 + 3(1 + 3(...)) and that repeats nine times. Hmm, no, wait. Let me count: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time it's wrapped in another 3(1 + ...). So actually, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the expression step by step. The entire expression is 3 multiplied by a big parenthesis. Inside that parenthesis, it's 1 + 3 multiplied by another parenthesis, which itself contains 1 + 3 times another parenthesis, and so on. Each time, it's 1 plus 3 times the next level. So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))))\). So, each 3 is followed by an opening parenthesis, which is closed after each 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the first 3, how many times does this pattern repeat? Let me see: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. ...3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. ...3(1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after the initial 3, there are eight more layers, right? Because each 3 is followed by a parenthesis, and starting from the first one, we have 9 layers? Or is it 8? Hmm, maybe I should write it down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe it's easier to recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. Let me think. Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's like a recursive formula where each term is 1 + 3 times the next term. If I can express this as a recursive sequence, maybe I can compute it step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost expression as a starting point. Let's define a sequence where a₁ = 1 + 3. Then, a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁, a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂, and so on, until a₉, since there are nine layers. Then, the entire expression is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that correct? Let me check. The innermost expression is 1 + 3, which is a₁ = 4. Then the next layer is 1 + 3*a₁, which is 1 + 12 = 13. Then a₃ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Hmm, so each time, it's 1 + 3*(previous term). So, if I can compute a₁ through a₉, then the entire expression is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me confirm the number of terms. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is a₁. Then each layer adds another a₂, a₃, up to a₉? So, if there are nine layers, starting from a₁, then we have a₁ to a₉, which is nine terms. So, the total expression is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the layers. Let me see the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3 is the first layer, then each 1 + 3*(...) is a layer. So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times ""1 + 3("" appears: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. ...1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. ...1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, that's nine layers. So, starting from a₁ = 1 + 3, then a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁, up to a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈. Then, the entire expression is 3*a₉. <nEwLiNe>So, let's compute a₁ through a₉ step by step. <nEwLiNe>a₁ = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a₂ = 1 + 3*a₁ = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a₃ = 1 + 3*a₂ = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a₄ = 1 + 3*a₃ = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a₅ = 1 + 3*a₄ = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a₆ = 1 + 3*a₅ = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a₇ = 1 + 3*a₆ = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a₈ = 1 + 3*a₇ = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a₉ = 1 + 3*a₈ = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*a₉ = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>First, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3 = 15, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*      3 <nEwLiNe>---------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression equals 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check my computations step by step because it's easy to make a mistake in such a long calculation. <nEwLiNe>Starting with a₁: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₂: 1 + 3*4 = 1 +12=13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₃: 1 + 3*13=1+39=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₄: 1 +3*40=1+120=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₅:1 +3*121=1+363=364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₆:1 +3*364=1+1092=1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₇:1 +3*1093=1+3279=3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₈:1 +3*3280=1+9840=9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>a₉:1 +3*9841=1+29523=29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then 3*a₉=3*29524=88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, yes, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive expression? Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each aₙ = 1 + 3*aₙ₋₁, with a₁ =4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is found by solving aₙ - 3*aₙ₋₁ =1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. The general solution is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is aₙ - 3*aₙ₋₁ =0, whose solution is aₙ = C*3ⁿ. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant solution, say aₙ = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: K -3*K=1 => -2K=1 => K= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is aₙ = C*3ⁿ -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a₁=4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1: a₁= C*3¹ -1/2 = 3C -1/2 =4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3C =4 +1/2=9/2 => C= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general term is aₙ= (3/2)*3ⁿ -1/2= (3ⁿ⁺¹)/2 -1/2= (3ⁿ⁺¹ -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, aₙ=(3ⁿ⁺¹ -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉=(3¹⁰ -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3¹⁰: 3^1=3, 3²=9, 3³=27, 3⁴=81, 3⁵=243, 3⁶=729, 3⁷=2187, 3⁸=6561, 3⁹=19683, 3¹⁰=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a₉=(59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a₉=3*29524=88572. <nEwLiNe>So, that's consistent with the step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*(previous). So, it's a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 and then adds 1. <nEwLiNe>But since we've already confirmed with both step-by-step computation and the closed-form formula, I'm confident that the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>I don't think I made any mistakes in the calculations. Each step followed logically, and the closed-form formula corroborates the iterative computation. So, yeah, 88572 should be the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer follows the pattern \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous result)}\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the final result is multiplied by 3. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form formula for the recursive sequence, the result is found to be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}"

 Hmm, maybe I can simplify this step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write it down in parts to make it clearer. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the innermost part as A. So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3A, which I'll call B. <nEwLiNe>Then, the next layer is 1 + 3B, which I'll call C. <nEwLiNe>And this pattern continues until I get to the outermost layer. Since there are nine sets of parentheses, I think there are nine layers here. Let me count: starting from A, then B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. So nine layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Alright, let's compute each step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3A = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Next, <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3B = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3*13 is 39, plus 1 is 40. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: <nEwLiNe>D = 1 + 3C = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, 3*40 is 120, plus 1 is 121. That seems correct. <nEwLiNe>Moving on, <nEwLiNe>E = 1 + 3D = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>3*121 is 363, plus 1 is 364. <nEwLiNe>Next, <nEwLiNe>F = 1 + 3E = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>3*364 is 1092, plus 1 is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>G = 1 + 3F = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Wait, 3*1093 is 3279, plus 1 is 3280. Okay. <nEwLiNe>Next layer, <nEwLiNe>H = 1 + 3G = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>3*3280 is 9840, plus 1 is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Proceeding, <nEwLiNe>I = 1 + 3H = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>3*9841 is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost expression is 3 times I, right? Because the original expression is 3(1 + 3(...)). So, the entire expression is 3*I. <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: Let's break it down. <nEwLiNe>3*20000 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>3*9000 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>3*500 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>3*24 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 72 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when doing multiple layers, it's easy to miscompute a step. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>A = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>C = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>D = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>F = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>G = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>H = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>I = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>3*I = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yep, each step seems correct. So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula instead of computing each step manually. Let me think about that. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 1. It's like a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Wait, if I denote each layer as a_n, where a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3a_1, and so on, then the recurrence relation is a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it using the method for linear nonhomogeneous recursions. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is the homogeneous solution plus a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0, which has the characteristic equation r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. So the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, for the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition. Wait, but in our case, the first term is a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, when n=1, a_1 = 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2 => 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general term is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>If a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2, then for n=1, a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=2, a_2 should be 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Using the formula: a_2 = (3^3 - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for each layer, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Given that, our innermost layer was a_1 = 4, and each subsequent layer is a_2, a_3, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in our problem, the outermost expression is 3*(a_9). Because each layer is 1 + 3*previous, starting from a_1 = 4, so a_9 is the ninth term. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*(3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>3^{10} is 59049. <nEwLiNe>So, 59049 -1 = 59048. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Then multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. So, that's a good consistency check. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, whether I compute each layer step by step or use the formula derived from the recurrence relation, I arrive at the same result: 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, I feel confident that 88572 is the correct value of the given expression. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Hmm, let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to work with these kinds of nested expressions.  <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. Okay, so that simplifies the innermost part to 4.  <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, no, actually, looking back at the expression, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, maybe I need to substitute the innermost parentheses first and then work my way out. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, moving one layer out, it's 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*4. Let's compute that: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the next layer is 13.  <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Hmm, so the next layer is 40.  <nEwLiNe>Continuing this pattern, the next layer would be 1 + 3*40: <nEwLiNe>1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>So, now we have 121. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*121. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*121 first: 3*120 is 360, plus 3 is 363. So, 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>So, the next result is 364. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*364. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*364: 3*300 is 900, 3*60 is 180, 3*4 is 12. Adding those together: 900 + 180 is 1080, plus 12 is 1092. So, 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>So, the next result is 1093. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, next layer: 1 + 3*1093. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*1093. 3*1000 is 3000, 3*90 is 270, 3*3 is 9. Adding them up: 3000 + 270 is 3270, plus 9 is 3279. Then, 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>So, now we have 3280. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*3280. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*3280. 3*3000 is 9000, 3*280 is 840. So, 9000 + 840 = 9840. Then, 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 9841. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*9841. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 3*9841. Hmm, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*800 is 2400, 3*40 is 120, 3*1 is 3. Adding those together: 27000 + 2400 is 29400, plus 120 is 29520, plus 3 is 29523. Then, 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 29524. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*29524. Let's break it down: 3*20000 is 60000, 3*9000 is 27000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*24 is 72. Adding these: 60000 + 27000 = 87000, plus 1500 is 88500, plus 72 is 88572. Then, 1 + 88572 = 88573. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88573. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, the next layer: 1 + 3*88573. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*88573. Let's do it step by step: 3*80000 is 240000, 3*8000 is 24000, 3*500 is 1500, 3*70 is 210, 3*3 is 9. Adding those: 240000 + 24000 = 264000, plus 1500 is 265500, plus 210 is 265710, plus 9 is 265719. Then, 1 + 265719 = 265720. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 265720. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*265720. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*265720. Let's see: 3*200000 is 600000, 3*60000 is 180000, 3*5000 is 15000, 3*700 is 2100, 3*20 is 60. Adding these: 600000 + 180000 = 780000, plus 15000 is 795000, plus 2100 is 797100, plus 60 is 797160. Then, 1 + 797160 = 797161. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 797161. <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*797161. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*797161. Let's break it down: 3*700000 is 2100000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*7000 is 21000, 3*100 is 300, 3*60 is 180, 3*1 is 3. Adding these: 2100000 + 270000 = 2370000, plus 21000 is 2391000, plus 300 is 2391300, plus 180 is 2391480, plus 3 is 2391483. Then, 1 + 2391483 = 2391484. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 2391484. <nEwLiNe>Continuing, the next layer: 1 + 3*2391484. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3*2391484. Let's do it step by step: 3*2000000 is 6000000, 3*300000 is 900000, 3*90000 is 270000, 3*1000 is 3000, 3*400 is 1200, 3*80 is 240, 3*4 is 12. Adding these: 6000000 + 900000 = 6900000, plus 270000 is 7170000, plus 3000 is 7173000, plus 1200 is 7174200, plus 240 is 7174440, plus 12 is 7174452. Then, 1 + 7174452 = 7174453. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 7174453. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on a second. Let me count how many layers I've computed so far. Each time I go out a layer, I'm replacing the innermost parentheses. Let me check how many layers there are in total. <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3(1+... parts: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...). So, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's easier to count the number of times 1+3 appears nested. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: 1+3. <nEwLiNe>Then, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1+... in the expression: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each time there's a 3(1+3(...

So, the number of layers is 9, because starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then 3*(1 + 3*...), and so on, until we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each 3(1 + ...) is another layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, the next is 3*(1 + ...), which is layer 2. <nEwLiNe>3. Then, layer 3, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, when I started computing, I had 1 + 3 as the first step, then each subsequent step was a layer. So, how many layers do I have? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, starting from the innermost, I have 1 + 3, then each time, 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then there are 8 more layers wrapping around it. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of closing parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another set of parentheses. Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(...: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is the first. <nEwLiNe>Then, each 3(1 + ... is a layer. So, how many 3(1 + 3(... are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me write them out: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the number of layers is equal to the number of times 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, each time after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(... So, the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, and then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check: starting from the innermost, we have 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each 3*(1 + ...) is a layer. So, starting from the innermost, layer 1: 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to layer 9: the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>So, that means I have 9 layers. Therefore, when I computed up to 7174453, that should be the outermost layer, right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I started computing, I went from the innermost to the outermost, computing each layer step by step, and I ended up with 7174453. But let me confirm that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 (layer 3) <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 (layer 4) <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 (layer 5) <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 (layer 6) <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 (layer 7) <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 (layer 8) <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 (layer 9) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's only 9 layers, but when I computed earlier, I went up to 7174453, which is way larger. So, I must have miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me clarify. The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed earlier, I went up to 9 layers and got 29524, but that seems inconsistent with the original expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me parse the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, we have 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is layer 2. <nEwLiNe>Continuing this, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the total number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I computed earlier, I started with 1 + 3 = 4 (layer 1), then 1 + 3*4 = 13 (layer 2), and so on, up to layer 9: 1 + 3*... = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the original expression has 9 layers, so the final result should be 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, I continued computing beyond that, thinking it was 9 layers, but I think I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is because the expression is written with multiple layers, but how many exactly? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each time, after the first 3, there's a 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of 3(1 + ...: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to how many? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, after the first 3(1 +, there are 8 more 3(1 + ... before the innermost 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write it out: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to Layer 9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is that each layer is a multiplication by 3 and addition of 1. So, perhaps the total number of operations is 9, meaning the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, if we have 9 layers, then the computation would be as follows: <nEwLiNe>Starting with layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result should be 29524. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, I continued computing beyond that, thinking it was more layers, but that must have been a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify the original expression again. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, that's the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3(1 + 3(... in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))). <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3*(1 + 3*(... is equal to the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the number of layers is 9, because the innermost is 1 + 3, and then each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, then 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and so on, until we have 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computation is as I did before, up to layer 9, which is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>But wait, earlier I thought I had 9 layers but ended up with a much larger number, 7174453, but that must be incorrect. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me recount the layers properly. <nEwLiNe>Original expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 (Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3*(...)) So, 3*(1 + 3*4) = 3*13 = 39? Wait, no, wait. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's different from before. Did I make a mistake earlier? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the order. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so this gives a different result: 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so now I'm confused. Earlier, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*previous, but now I'm seeing it as 3*(1 + previous). So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...)))) <nEwLiNe>So, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, it's 3*(1 + ...). So, the correct approach is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Therefore, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I thought each layer was 1 + 3*previous, I got 29524, which is different. <nEwLiNe>So, which approach is correct? <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + ... ))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next term). So, each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, the correct computation is Layer n = 3*(1 + Layer(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, when I misapplied the formula, I thought each layer was 1 + 3*previous, which is incorrect. The correct approach is each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this again step by step. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: Innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, I thought the innermost was 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*previous, but that was incorrect. The correct interpretation is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, that changes the computation entirely. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me double-check this with another approach. Perhaps recognizing a pattern or formula. <nEwLiNe>This expression is of the form 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))) with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a geometric series, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, it's a recurrence relation where each term is defined as a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with the previous computation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps we can find a closed-form formula for this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Given a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve it. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say a_n^{(p)} = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 3 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*K = 3 <nEwLiNe>K = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find C. <nEwLiNe>At n=1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>4 = 3*C - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Add 1.5 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>5.5 = 3*C <nEwLiNe>C = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write this as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n)/6 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify further: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n = 9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, 3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>Then, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*19683 - 9)/6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 11*19683: <nEwLiNe>11*19683 = (10 + 1)*19683 = 10*19683 + 1*19683 = 196830 + 19683 = 216,513 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504 <nEwLiNe>Now, divide by 6: 216,504 / 6 <nEwLiNe>Compute 216,504 / 6: <nEwLiNe>6*36,000 = 216,000 <nEwLiNe>216,504 - 216,000 = 504 <nEwLiNe>504 / 6 = 84 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, total is 36,000 + 84 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = 36,084 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>So, the initial confusion was due to misapplying the recurrence relation, but upon carefully analyzing and even deriving the closed-form formula, we arrive at the same result: 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern of 3 multiplied by (1 plus the result of the previous layer). This results in the final value of 36,084. <nEwLiNe>$\boxed{36084}$"
7,36084,0,1,3837,"
 Okay, let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe I'll start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually makes sense with nested expressions. So, let me rewrite the expression to make it clearer. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost part is (1 + 3). Let's compute that first. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one layer out, it becomes 3 times the result of the previous step plus 1. Wait, no, actually, looking at the structure, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, it's like each step is 3*(1 + previous step). Hmm, maybe I can represent this as a sequence where each term depends on the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence \( a_n \) where \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), and then each subsequent term \( a_{n+1} = 3(1 + a_n) \). So, starting with \( a_1 = 4 \), then \( a_2 = 3(1 + a_1) \), \( a_3 = 3(1 + a_2) \), and so on, up to \( a_9 \), since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of parentheses. Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer, and since the original expression has 9 closing parentheses, each corresponding to a layer, so there are 9 layers. So, \( a_1 \) to \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>So, starting with \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_2 = 3(1 + a_1) = 3(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \). <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_3 = 3(1 + a_2) = 3(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \). <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_4 = 3(1 + a_3) = 3(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \). <nEwLiNe>Continuing, \( a_5 = 3(1 + a_4) = 3(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \). <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_6 = 3(1 + a_5) = 3(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \). <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_7 = 3(1 + a_6) = 3(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \). <nEwLiNe>Moving on, \( a_8 = 3(1 + a_7) = 3(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \). <nEwLiNe>Finally, \( a_9 = 3(1 + a_8) = 3(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \). <nEwLiNe>So, according to this, the value of the original expression is 36084. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big number, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>1. \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \) – that's correct. <nEwLiNe>2. \( a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 \) – still correct. <nEwLiNe>3. \( a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 \) – correct. <nEwLiNe>4. \( a_4 = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 \) – yes. <nEwLiNe>5. \( a_5 = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 \) – still okay. <nEwLiNe>6. \( a_6 = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 \) – correct. <nEwLiNe>7. \( a_7 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 \) – yes. <nEwLiNe>8. \( a_8 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 \) – correct. <nEwLiNe>9. \( a_9 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 \) – yes, that's consistent. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify if the number of layers is indeed 9. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... 9 times ...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer wraps it with 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of multiplications by 3 is 9, which would correspond to 9 layers, so \( a_9 \) is the outermost layer. So, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to be thorough, maybe I can compute it step by step manually without defining the sequence. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's different from my previous result. Now I'm confused. Which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>In my first approach, I defined \( a_n \) starting with \( a_1 = 4 \), then each \( a_{n+1} = 3*(1 + a_n) \). So, \( a_1 = 4 \), \( a_2 = 15 \), \( a_3 = 48 \), etc., up to \( a_9 = 36084 \). <nEwLiNe>But when I tried computing manually, starting from the innermost, I got 4, then 13, 40, 121, 364, 1093, 3280, 9841, 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's a discrepancy. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>I think I might have messed up the definition of \( a_n \). Let me see. <nEwLiNe>In the first approach, I considered \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). Then each subsequent \( a_n \) is 3*(1 + previous a). So, \( a_1 = 4 \), \( a_2 = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 \), \( a_3 = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 \), etc., up to \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>But in the second approach, starting from the innermost, each step is (1 + 3*previous). So, starting from 4, then 1 + 3*4 = 13, then 1 + 3*13 = 40, etc. So, in this case, the outermost layer is 1 + 3*... So, the final result is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, it's 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is 3*(1 + ...). So, in the second approach, I computed up to 29524, which would be the value inside the outermost 3*(...). So, the total expression would be 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that can't be, because the original expression is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is 3*(1 + ...), etc., so actually, the innermost is (1 + 3), then each layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, then the next layer is 3*(1 + 12) = 39, then 3*(1 + 39) = 120, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so perhaps in my second approach, I was incorrectly computing 1 + 3*... instead of 3*(1 + ...). So, maybe my second approach was flawed because I forgot to multiply by 3 at each step. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's consistent with the first method. So, my second approach was wrong because I was mistakenly adding 1 after multiplying by 3, but actually, each step is 3*(1 + previous). So, the correct value is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me just compute it step by step manually again to be 100% sure. <nEwLiNe>Start from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. Then, 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. Then, 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. Then, 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. Then, 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. Then, 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. Then, 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. Finally, 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. So, each step is multiplying 3 by (1 + the previous result). So, 9 layers give us 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a formula for this kind of recursive expression. It seems like a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Let me think. The expression can be written as: <nEwLiNe>\( E = 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \) <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as \( E_n \), where \( E_1 = 3(1 + 3) = 12 \), \( E_2 = 3(1 + E_1) = 3(1 + 12) = 39 \), \( E_3 = 3(1 + E_2) = 3(1 + 39) = 120 \), and so on up to \( E_9 \). <nEwLiNe>But wait, actually, in my first approach, \( a_1 = 4 \), which is \( 1 + 3 \), then each \( a_{n} = 3(1 + a_{n-1}) \). So, \( a_1 = 4 \), \( a_2 = 15 \), \( a_3 = 48 \), etc., and \( E = a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, if I consider the expression as starting with the innermost \( (1 + 3) \), then each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous). So, after 9 layers, it's 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can represent this recursively as \( a_n = 3(1 + a_{n-1}) \), with \( a_1 = 4 \). Then, the solution to this recurrence relation can be found. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is linear and can be solved. The general solution for such a recurrence is: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = A \cdot 3^n + B \), where A and B are constants. <nEwLiNe>But actually, the homogeneous solution is \( A \cdot 3^n \), and the particular solution is a constant. Let's find it. <nEwLiNe>Assume particular solution \( a_p = C \). Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>\( C = 3(1 + C) \) <nEwLiNe>\( C = 3 + 3C \) <nEwLiNe>\( C - 3C = 3 \) <nEwLiNe>\( -2C = 3 \) <nEwLiNe>\( C = -3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = A \cdot 3^n - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition \( a_1 = 4 \): <nEwLiNe>\( 4 = A \cdot 3^1 - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>\( 4 = 3A - 1.5 \) <nEwLiNe>\( 3A = 4 + 1.5 = 5.5 \) <nEwLiNe>\( A = 5.5 / 3 = 11/6 \) <nEwLiNe>So, the solution is: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = (11/6) \cdot 3^n - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = (11/6) \cdot 3^n - 3/2 = (11 \cdot 3^{n-1}) - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me compute \( a_1 \): <nEwLiNe>\( a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, \( a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - 3/2 = 30/2 = 15 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula works. Therefore, for \( n = 9 \): <nEwLiNe>\( a_9 = (11/6) * 3^9 - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, 3280.5 * 11 = let's compute 3280 * 11 = 36080, and 0.5 * 11 = 5.5, so total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 3/2 = 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = 36084 \). That's the same result as before. So, this confirms that the value is indeed 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after carefully computing step by step, both manually and using the recurrence relation formula, I arrive at the same answer: 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

 Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe if I work from the innermost parentheses outwards, it'll make more sense. So, starting from the innermost part: <nEwLiNe>The innermost expression is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times the previous result. So, let's compute that. Wait, actually, in the expression, each layer is 3 multiplied by (1 plus the next layer). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that gives 4. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). Hmm, maybe I should write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me check. Each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from L1=4, then L2=3*(1 + 4)=15, then L3=3*(1 + 15)=3*16=48, and so on. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify how many layers there are. Looking back at the original expression: starting from the innermost 1+3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let's count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Each time, we have a 3 multiplied by (1 + ...). So, from the innermost, each step is another layer. Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + result from 1) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + result from 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>How many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a new layer. Let me count the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>- Then 1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>- Each subsequent layer adds another 1 + 3(...) <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 1 + 3(...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost layer. Let's see, the expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost is 1+3, then each layer adds another 1+3(...).

Let me check. Each time, we have an additional layer. So starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, that's layer 1. Then, each subsequent 1 + 3(...) is another layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out: <nEwLiNe>- Layer 2: 3*(1 + layer1) <nEwLiNe>- Layer 3: 3*(1 + layer2) <nEwLiNe>- ... <nEwLiNe>- Up to layer n. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression, the number of 3(1 + ... is 8, because each time we have a 3 followed by (1 + ...).

So, starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers, each being 3*(1 + previous layer). But wait, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, and then each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, starting from 4, we have 8 more layers? Or is it 9 layers? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is defined by a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), starting from a_1 = 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous).

Therefore, the total number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, which is layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression equals 108,255. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this step by step, just to be sure. <nEwLiNe>Let's compute each layer: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that seems different. Wait, in layer 9, is it 3*(1 + 12027) or 3*(1 + 36084)? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, I think I messed up the layers. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>If layer 1 is 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then layer 2 is 3*(1 + layer1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is 3*(1 + layer2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 is 3*(1 + layer3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 is 3*(1 + layer4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 is 3*(1 + layer5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 is 3*(1 + layer6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 is 3*(1 + layer7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 is 3*(1 + layer8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(1 + layer9) = 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so the total expression is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm this by computing step by step. <nEwLiNe>Compute layer1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Compute layer9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + 36084) = 3*36085 = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a geometric series or find a pattern or formula for such nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>Let me see if I can find a general formula for such a nested expression where each layer is 3*(1 + previous). <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the entire expression as S. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... ))), which is similar to a continued multiplication. <nEwLiNe>This is similar to a recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation.

So, I'm confident the answer is 108,255. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let me think about the pattern here. Each layer is 3 times one more than the previous layer.

 Okay, let me break this down. Since the expression is repeated multiple times, maybe I can find a pattern or a formula for it. Let me start from the innermost part and work my way outwards.  <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple: 1 + 3 = 4.  <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, it becomes 1 + 3*(previous result). So, if the innermost is 4, then the next layer is 1 + 3*4. Let me compute that: 3*4 = 12, and then 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Moving out another layer, it's again 1 + 3*(previous result). So, 1 + 3*13. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, and 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so each time I go out a layer, I'm doing 1 + 3*(the result from the previous layer). Let me write down these steps systematically to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each layer as \( a_n \), where n is the layer number starting from the innermost. So, the innermost is \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>Then, \( a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \). <nEwLiNe>Next, \( a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \). <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way: <nEwLiNe>\( a_4 = 1 + 3*a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \). <nEwLiNe>\( a_5 = 1 + 3*a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \). <nEwLiNe>\( a_6 = 1 + 3*a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \). <nEwLiNe>\( a_7 = 1 + 3*a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \). <nEwLiNe>\( a_8 = 1 + 3*a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \). <nEwLiNe>\( a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \). <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, the original expression is 3*(a_9). So, I have to compute 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = 29524 \), so 3*29524 = ? <nEwLiNe>Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>First, multiply 29,524 by 3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost layer: <nEwLiNe>1. \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>2. \( a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 \). <nEwLiNe>3. \( a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 \). <nEwLiNe>4. \( a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 \). <nEwLiNe>5. \( a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 \). <nEwLiNe>6. \( a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 \). <nEwLiNe>7. \( a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 \). <nEwLiNe>8. \( a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 \). <nEwLiNe>9. \( a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 \). <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Hmm, seems consistent. Let me verify each multiplication step just to be sure. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_1 = 4 \) is straightforward. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \).

Correct. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>- \( a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524: Let me compute 29524*3 again. <nEwLiNe>29524*3: <nEwLiNe>- 4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>- 5*3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>- 9*3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>- 2*3 = 6 + 2 = 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88572. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute 29524*3 another way. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>Break it down: <nEwLiNe>20000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>20 * 3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Now, add them all together: <nEwLiNe>60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 + 60 = 88,560 <nEwLiNe>88,560 + 12 = 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. So, 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I could think of this as a geometric series or find a formula for such a nested expression. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the structure, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \) with \( a_1 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is \( a_n = A*3^{n} + B \), where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think. The recurrence is \( a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 1 \). So, it's a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is \( a_n^{(h)} = C*3^n \). <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say \( a_n^{(p)} = K \). <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: \( K = 3K + 1 \). <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: \( K - 3K = 1 \) => \( -2K = 1 \) => \( K = -1/2 \). <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is \( a_n = C*3^n - 1/2 \). <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition \( a_1 = 4 \): <nEwLiNe>\( 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 \) => \( 4 = 3C - 1/2 \) => \( 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 \) => \( C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 \). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is \( a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 \). <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \). <nEwLiNe>Let me verify this formula with the earlier terms. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: \( a_1 = (3^{2} -1)/2 = (9 -1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: \( a_2 = (3^{3} -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: \( a_3 = (3^4 -1)/2 = (81 -1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=4: \( a_4 = (3^5 -1)/2 = (243 -1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \). Correct. <nEwLiNe>Perfect, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: \( a_9 = (3^{10} -1)/2 \). <nEwLiNe>Compute \( 3^{10} \): 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \). Which matches my earlier result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula, since the original expression is 3*(a_9) = 3*( (3^{10} -1)/2 ) = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute \( 3^{11} \): 3^10 is 59049, so 3^11 is 177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 - 3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88,572. Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is consistent. <nEwLiNe>I think I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{88572} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, let me try to break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll be easier to handle. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, no. Let me make sure. Each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). So, let me number these layers for clarity. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3(Layer 1) <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3(Layer 2) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to Layer 9, since there are nine sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>So, Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. So, each layer is computed by multiplying the previous layer by 3 and adding 1. That seems like a geometric progression. Let me verify. <nEwLiNe>If I denote L_n as Layer n, then L_{n} = 1 + 3*L_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>With L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, L_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>L_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, as I did earlier. <nEwLiNe>But computing each layer step by step might take a while, but since there are only nine layers, it's manageable. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check my calculations because 3*(9841) is 29523, plus 1 is 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). Wait, no. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... )) So, the entire expression is 3*(Layer 9). So, Layer 9 is 29524, then the entire expression is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) So, each layer is inside another 3*(1 + ...). So, if Layer 1 is (1 + 3), then Layer 2 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 1)), Layer 3 is 3*(1 + 3*(Layer 2)), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I was wrong before. Maybe each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression again: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute each step: <nEwLiNe>Let me define S1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, the entire expression is 3*(S9). Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*S9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, S9 is already 1 + 3*S8, and the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)) which is 3*S9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, if I parse from the inside: <nEwLiNe>Starting with (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each step is 1 + 3*(previous result). <nEwLiNe>So, as I computed, S1 = 4, S2 = 13, S3 = 40, ..., S9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(S9). So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so 3*29524. Let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: 4*3=12, carryover 1; 2*3=6 +1=7; 5*3=15, carryover 1; 9*3=27 +1=28, carryover 2; 2*3=6 +2=8. So, 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the total is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify that I didn't make a mistake in the layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me write them all down step by step: <nEwLiNe>S1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>S2 = 1 + 3*S1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>S3 = 1 + 3*S2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>S4 = 1 + 3*S3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>S5 = 1 + 3*S4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>S6 = 1 + 3*S5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>S7 = 1 + 3*S6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>S8 = 1 + 3*S7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>S9 = 1 + 3*S8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*S9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4 * 3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 1 = 7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5 * 3 = 15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9 * 3 = 27 + 1 = 28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2 * 3 = 6 + 2 = 8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, reading from top to bottom: 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me check if the number of layers is correct. The original expression has nine sets of parentheses, each starting with a 1 + 3(...). So, S1 to S9, each one building on the previous. <nEwLiNe>But when I computed S9, that was the innermost expression, right? Wait, no, actually, S1 was the innermost, and S9 was the outermost. So, the entire expression is 3*S9. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let me parse it again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the innermost is (1 + 3), which is S1=4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 3*S1), which is 3*S2. Wait, no, hold on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I misapplied the layers. Let me think differently. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression as E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Let's compute each bracket step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>E9 = (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>E8 = (1 + 3*E9) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E7 = (1 + 3*E8) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E6 = (1 + 3*E7) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = (1 + 3*E6) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E4 = (1 + 3*E5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E3 = (1 + 3*E4) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E2 = (1 + 3*E3) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E1 = (1 + 3*E2) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E1 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so E9 is the innermost, E8 next, up to E1, and the entire expression is 3*E1. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. So, the total is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me check each step to make sure I didn't make a multiplication error. <nEwLiNe>Compute E9: 1 + 3 = 4 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E8: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E7: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E6: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E4: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E3: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E2: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>E1: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Then, 3*29524 = 88572 ✔️ <nEwLiNe>So, yes, all steps check out. Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recurrence relation. Let me define a sequence where each term is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, the sequence is: <nEwLiNe>a1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>And the entire expression is 3*a9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, this confirms the previous calculation. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for such a recurrence relation. The general form is a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, which is a linear recurrence. The solution can be found using standard techniques. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is a_n^h = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For a particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n^p = K. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = a_n^h + a_n^p = C*3^n - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, whether I compute step by step or use the closed-form formula, I arrive at the same result: 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. Each step checks out, and the closed-form solution corroborates the iterative computation. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed step by step by expanding from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the form \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous layer)}\). After computing each layer up to the ninth, the entire expression is three times the ninth layer. Using both iterative computation and a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation, the result is confirmed to be 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}"

 Okay, let me try to break this down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Now, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3 times that result. Wait, let me see: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + something). So starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 1 + 3*(first layer) = 1 + 3*4. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 3*(second layer), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, let me count how many layers there are. Each opening parenthesis adds a layer. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost, which is 1+3, that's one layer. Then each subsequent layer wraps around that. Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3(. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So starting from the first 3(, each subsequent layer is another 3(1 + ...). Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that 9 layers? Let me check: <nEwLiNe>After the initial 3, there are 9 sets of (1 + 3(...)), so yes, 9 layers. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So it's a recursive expression with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>So, to compute this, I can compute each layer starting from the innermost and moving outward. Let me denote each layer as L1, L2, ..., L9, where L1 is the innermost. <nEwLiNe>So, L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 1 + 3*L1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on: each layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, if I have L1 = 4, then L2 = 1 + 3*L1. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. So, each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, let me compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write down each computation: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2 = 1 + 3*L1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>L3 = 1 + 3*L2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. <nEwLiNe>L4 = 1 + 3*L3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. <nEwLiNe>L5 = 1 + 3*L4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. <nEwLiNe>L6 = 1 + 3*L5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. <nEwLiNe>L7 = 1 + 3*L6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. <nEwLiNe>L8 = 1 + 3*L7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. <nEwLiNe>L9 = 1 + 3*L8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, after computing each layer, the outermost layer is L9 = 29524. Therefore, the entire expression is equal to 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify that. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations somewhere. <nEwLiNe>Let me go through each step again: <nEwLiNe>L1: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all layers compute correctly. Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me think again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) nine times. But in my computation, I considered each layer as starting with 1 + 3*previous, but is the outermost layer multiplied by 3? <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me look at the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)). So the entire expression is 3*(L9), where L9 is 1 + 3*(L8). So, in my previous calculation, I computed L9 as 29524, but actually, that would be the value of the innermost part, right? <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I confused the layers. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the expression is 3*(L1), where L1 is 1 + 3*(L2), and so on, with L9 being 1 + 3*(L10), but there is no L10. Wait, maybe I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the expression as: <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>Next layer: 1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>And so on, until the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>But the entire expression is 3*(...). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me write the expression with indices. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>So, in my previous computation, I computed E9 as 29524, but actually, the entire expression is 3*E9, which would be 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, that's a big difference. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, it's 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(...)), which is E1 to E9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*E2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*E3 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*E4 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*E5 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*E6 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*E7 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*E8 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial calculation, I computed E9 as 29524, but actually, the entire expression is 3*E9, so 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, my initial conclusion was incorrect because I forgot that the outermost 3 multiplies the entire expression. <nEwLiNe>So, to correct that, let me compute each Ei step by step: <nEwLiNe>E1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>E2 = 1 + 3*E1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>E3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>E4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>E5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>E6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>E7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>E8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>E9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute 29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify the multiplication: <nEwLiNe>29524 <nEwLiNe>*      3 <nEwLiNe>-------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So yes, 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I thought L9 was the outermost, but actually, the outermost is 3*L9. <nEwLiNe>So, to prevent confusion, perhaps I should have labeled the innermost as E1, then each subsequent as E2, etc., and then the entire expression is 3*E9. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that makes sense. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the expression is a geometric series or something similar, but given the structure, it's a linear recurrence. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but maybe I can find a formula for such expressions. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is E_n = A*3^n + B, where A and B are constants determined by initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>Let me solve the recurrence relation E_n = 1 + 3*E_{n-1}, with E1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution: E_n^(h) = C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant, assume E_n^(p) = K. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>K = 1 + 3*K <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>K - 3K = 1 => -2K = 1 => K = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is E_n = C*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Apply initial condition E1 = 4: <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3C - 1/2 => 3C = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => C = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9, E9 = (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^10: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^10=59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, E9 = (59049 -1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>So, that confirms my earlier computation that E9 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, using the formula, E_n = (3^{n+1} -1)/2, so the entire expression is 3*E9 = 3*(3^{10} -1)/2 = (3^{11} -3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: 3^10=59049, so 3^11=177147. <nEwLiNe>Thus, (177147 -3)/2 = 177144/2 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>Same result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, regardless of the method, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, my initial confusion was whether the outermost 3 was part of the expression or not. But upon careful consideration, yes, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by the nested parentheses, which evaluates to 88,572. <nEwLiNe>I think that's the correct answer. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer starting from the innermost parentheses and working outward. Each layer follows the pattern \(1 + 3 \times \text{previous layer}\). After computing each layer up to the ninth layer, the result is multiplied by 3.

 Okay, let's break it down step by step. Maybe if I start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out, it'll make more sense.  <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me write that down: 1 + 3 equals 4. So, replacing that, the next layer out would be 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 is 12. Hmm, wait, is that right? Let me make sure. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer is 1 + 3*(the next layer). So, starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 1 + 3*(4) = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Next: 1 + 3*(13) = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Next: 1 + 3*(40) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Next: 1 + 3*(121) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Next: 1 + 3*(364) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Next: 1 + 3*(1093) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Next: 1 + 3*(3280) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Next: 1 + 3*(9841) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally: 1 + 3*(29524) = 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on, the original expression is 3 multiplied by all that. So, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which we just computed as 88573. So, is the final answer 3*88573? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me check again. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). So, if the innermost is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Let's count the number of layers. The expression has 9 sets of parentheses, each starting with 1 + 3(...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Let me label them from inside out as layers 1 to 9. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 1 + 3*(Layer 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 1 + 3*(Layer 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 1 + 3*(Layer 3) = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 1 + 3*(Layer 4) = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 1 + 3*(Layer 5) = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 1 + 3*(Layer 6) = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 1 + 3*(Layer 7) = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 1 + 3*(Layer 8) = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after 9 layers, we get 29524. But the original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) which after 8 layers would be 29524? Wait, no. Let me recount. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's the first innermost. Then each subsequent is 1 + 3*(previous). So, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3*(1 + 3*(...). Each 1 + 3*(... is a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting after the first 3*(1 + 3*(...), each 1 + 3*( is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3*(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, each layer adds another 1 + 3*(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3*( occurs. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>- The innermost is 1 + 3, which is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each time we have 1 + 3*(previous). So, each layer adds one more. So, how many layers? <nEwLiNe>The expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 1 + 3*( inside the main expression. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3*(1 + 3*(...), then each subsequent is another layer. So, the main expression is 3*(layer1), where layer1 is 1 + 3*(layer2), layer2 is 1 + 3*(layer3), etc., until the innermost layer. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Starting with 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then each layer: <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost is 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so after 9 layers inside, we have 29524, and then multiplied by 3 gives 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I labeled layer1 as 1 + 3, layer2 as 1 + 3*layer1, etc., up to layer9, which is 29524, and then the outermost is 3*layer9, which is 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, is that the final answer? 88572? <nEwLiNe>But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple layers, it's easy to miscount. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a geometric series or find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is defined by a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, starting from a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, yes, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can represent this recursion as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe we can find a closed-form formula. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^{n} + B, where B is a constant particular solution. <nEwLiNe>Let's solve for the particular solution. Assume a_n = C. <nEwLiNe>Then, substituting into the recurrence: C = 1 + 3*C => C - 3C = 1 => -2C = 1 => C = -1/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^{n} - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^{1} - 1/2 => 4 + 1/2 = 3A => 9/2 = 3A => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form is a_n = (3/2)*3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, let's compute 3*29524: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1 <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2 <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524*3=88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, after carefully computing each layer step by step and verifying with a closed-form formula, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is calculated by evaluating each nested layer from the innermost parentheses outward. Each layer follows the pattern \(1 + 3 \times \text{(previous result)}\).

 Okay, let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me confirm: starting from the very inside, the expression is 1 + 3, and then each layer wraps that result with 3*(1 + ...).  <nEwLiNe>Let me write it out layer by layer to visualize better. Maybe if I denote each layer as L1, L2, up to L9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. Let me check: starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, that's L1. Then, moving outwards, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, L2 would be 3*(1 + L1), L3 would be 3*(1 + L2), and so on until L9, which is the outermost layer.  <nEwLiNe>So, let me define each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, L2 = 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15 <nEwLiNe>Next, L3 = 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48 <nEwLiNe>Then, L4 = 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147 <nEwLiNe>Continuing, L5 = 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444 <nEwLiNe>Next, L6 = 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Then, L7 = 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Moving on, L8 = 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Finally, L9 = 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so L9 is the outermost layer, which is the entire expression. So, the value should be 36084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations, let me go through each step again. <nEwLiNe>Starting with L1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward. <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Yep. <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49. Hmm, 3*49 is 147. Right. <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let me compute 3*148. 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24. So, 300+120+24=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + 444)=3*445. Let's compute 445*3. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200+120=1320, +15=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + 1335)=3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3. 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So, 3000+900=3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + 4008)=3*4009. Calculating 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000+27=12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + 12027)=3*12028. Let me compute 12028*3. 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. Adding them up: 30000+6000=36000, +84=36084. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, all layers compute correctly, and the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for this kind of nested expression? It seems like each layer is a geometric progression or something similar. Let me think. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}). So, it's a recurrence relation where each term is 3 times (1 plus the previous term). That seems like a linear recurrence. Maybe I can solve it more formally. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the recurrence relation: <nEwLiNe>L_n = 3*(1 + L_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>With L_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. Let me see if I can find a closed-form solution. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write the recurrence in standard form: <nEwLiNe>L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is: <nEwLiNe>L_n - 3*L_{n-1} = 0 <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n^h = C*3^n <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say L_n^p = A. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>A - 3*A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>So, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, L_1=4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 4 = 3C - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Adding 3/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>4 + 3/2 = 3C => 11/2 = 3C => C = 11/6 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>L_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} ) - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, 11/6 * 3^n is equal to (11/6)*3^n. Let me see if that's consistent with L1. <nEwLiNe>For n=1: <nEwLiNe>L1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=2: <nEwLiNe>L2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>For n=3: <nEwLiNe>L3 = (11/6)*27 - 3/2 = (297/6) - 3/2 = (99/2) - (3/2) = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Good, so the formula works. <nEwLiNe>Thus, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>L9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>L9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute (11/6)*19683: <nEwLiNe>First, 19683 divided by 6: 19683 / 6 = 3280.5 <nEwLiNe>Then, multiply by 11: 3280.5 * 11 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3280 * 11 = 36080 <nEwLiNe>Compute 0.5 * 11 = 5.5 <nEwLiNe>So, total is 36080 + 5.5 = 36085.5 <nEwLiNe>Then subtract 3/2, which is 1.5: <nEwLiNe>36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084 <nEwLiNe>So, L9 = 36084, which matches my earlier step-by-step computation. So, that confirms that the result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3 times (1 + previous layer), which is similar to 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + ...)), which might be similar to a geometric series, but since each term is multiplied by 3 and adds 3 each time, it's a bit different. <nEwLiNe>But since I already have a closed-form formula and both methods gave me the same result, I feel confident that the answer is 36084. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, I computed each layer step by step, starting from the innermost, and then I also derived a general formula for the nth layer, which confirmed the result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the given expression is 36084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{36084}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, let me break it down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That usually works for these kinds of nested expressions. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. Got it. Now, moving one layer out, the next part is 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4. Let me calculate that. <nEwLiNe>3 * 4 = 12. Alright, so the next layer is 1 + 12. Let me do that. <nEwLiNe>1 + 12 = 13. Hmm, okay, moving out another layer, we have 3 times 13. <nEwLiNe>3 * 13 = 39. Now, the next layer is 1 + 39. Let me add those. <nEwLiNe>1 + 39 = 40. Continuing outward, 3 times 40. <nEwLiNe>3 * 40 = 120. Next layer: 1 + 120. <nEwLiNe>1 + 120 = 121. Then, 3 times 121. <nEwLiNe>3 * 121 = 363. Next, 1 + 363. <nEwLiNe>1 + 363 = 364.

Then, 3 times 3280. <nEwLiNe>3 * 3280 = 9840. Next layer: 1 + 9840. <nEwLiNe>1 + 9840 = 9841. Then, 3 times 9841. <nEwLiNe>3 * 9841 = 29523. Next, 1 + 29523. <nEwLiNe>1 + 29523 = 29524.

The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the opening parentheses after each 3: there are 9 opening parentheses. So, that means 9 layers, right? But in my calculation above, I have 19 steps, which seems more than 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each time I have a layer, it's 3*(1 + something). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds two operations: one addition and one multiplication. <nEwLiNe>So, starting with (1 + 3), that's one layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out, each subsequent layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So, each layer is a multiplication and an addition. <nEwLiNe>So, for 9 layers, how many operations would that be? Each layer has one multiplication and one addition, except maybe the first one? <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Innermost: (1 + 3) = 4. That's one addition. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3 * 4 = 12. That's one multiplication. <nEwLiNe>Then, 1 + 12 = 13. That's another addition. <nEwLiNe>Then, 3 * 13 = 39. Another multiplication. <nEwLiNe>So, each layer adds two operations: addition and multiplication. <nEwLiNe>But in the expression, each ""layer"" is 3*(1 + ...). So, for each set of parentheses, we have an addition and a multiplication. So, for n layers, we have 2n operations. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, how many layers are there? Let's count the number of 3's before the innermost (1 + 3). Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is nested inside. So, the number of 3's before the innermost (1 + 3) is 8? Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is multiplied by (1 + ...), which is the first layer. <nEwLiNe>Then, inside that, there's another 3 multiplied by (1 + ...), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3's are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) - that's the outermost 3. <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer has another 3: <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3). So, how many 3's? Let's see: starting from the first one, each layer adds another 3. So, from the outermost to the innermost, it's 9 layers because each time we have a 3(1 + ...). So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, 9 layers, each involving an addition and a multiplication. So, 18 operations. Hmm, but in my previous calculation, I had 19 steps. Maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let's recount: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. 3 * 88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so that's 20 steps, which is 10 layers? But earlier I thought it was 9 layers. Hmm, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's look at the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of opening parentheses after each 3. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>- After the first 3: (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>- Then, inside that, another (1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>- Continuing until the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does ""3("" appear? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside that, another 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. And so on, until the innermost 3(1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>2. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>3. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>4. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>5. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>6. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>7. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>8. 3(1 + 3(... <nEwLiNe>9. 3(1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 instances of ""3("" in the expression. Therefore, 9 layers. So, each layer is a multiplication and addition. So, 9 layers, 18 operations. But in my calculation, I have 20 steps, which is 10 layers. So, I must have miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in how we count the layers. Each ""3("" corresponds to a layer, but each layer includes both a multiplication and an addition. So, for each ""3("", we have a multiplication and an addition. <nEwLiNe>But in the initial step, we have (1 + 3), which is the innermost layer, and then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication and addition. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to visualize the expression as a tree. Each node is a 3*(1 + ...), and the leaves are (1 + 3). So, the depth of the tree is 9, meaning 9 layers of multiplication and addition. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, to compute it, we need to compute from the leaves up, each time combining two operations. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving up, 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...), where the ... is the next layer. So, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is 9, so starting from layer 1: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so after 9 layers, we get 88572. But the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so that would mean another layer on top of that. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(1 + (result of 8 layers)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, actually, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of 3*(...). So, the first layer is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), and the innermost is 3*(1 + 3). So, in total, it's 9 layers of 3*(1 + ...), each nested inside the previous one. <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>But wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), which is 3*(1 + Layer 9). So, Layer 10 would be 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Ah, so actually, there are 10 layers in total. The first 9 layers are inside the outermost 3*(1 + ...). So, the outermost expression is 3*(1 + result of 9 layers). Therefore, after computing 9 layers, we get 88572, then we have 1 + 88572 = 88573, and then 3*88573 = 265,719. <nEwLiNe>So, that makes sense. Therefore, the total number of layers is 10, which corresponds to 10 iterations of 3*(1 + ...). Therefore, the final result is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me confirm this by another method, maybe using a different approach or looking for a pattern. <nEwLiNe>I recall that expressions of the form a + b(a + b(a + ...)) can sometimes be expressed using a formula, especially if it's a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>But in this case, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). It's a bit different because each layer is 3*(1 + something). So, it's a recursive expression where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). So, we can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define the terms: <nEwLiNe>Let’s denote a_n as the value of the nth layer. So, a_1 is the innermost layer, which is 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Then, a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39, and so on. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}). <nEwLiNe>Given that, we can compute each term up to a_10, since there are 10 layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me compute them step by step: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 3*(1 + 88572) = 3*88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that matches my previous calculation. So, a_10 is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation: a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}), with a_1 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, let's write it as: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant solution, say a particular solution of the form C. <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C = 3 + 3*C <nEwLiNe>Solving for C: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 <nEwLiNe>-2*C = 3 <nEwLiNe>C = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2) <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 = 12. <nEwLiNe>a_1 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) = 3A - 3/2 = 12 <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 12 + 3/2 = 13.5 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A = 13.5 / 3 = 4.5 <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 4.5*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>We can write 4.5 as 9/2, so: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Factor out 3/2: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me verify that: <nEwLiNe>(9/2)*3^n - 3/2 = (3^2 / 2)*3^n - 3/2 = (3^{n+2} / 2) - 3/2 = (3^{n+2} - 3)/2 = (3*(3^{n+1} - 1))/2 = (3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check for n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (3/2)*(3^{2} - 1) = (3/2)*(9 - 1) = (3/2)*8 = 12, which matches. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, for n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (3/2)*(3^3 - 1) = (3/2)*(27 - 1) = (3/2)*26 = 39, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Great, so the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=10: <nEwLiNe>a_10 = (3/2)*(3^{11} - 1) <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{11}: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>3^11 = 177147 <nEwLiNe>So, a_10 = (3/2)*(177147 - 1) = (3/2)*177146 <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>177146 * 3 = 531,438 <nEwLiNe>Then, divide by 2: 531,438 / 2 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>So, a_10 = 265,719, which matches our previous result. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 265,719. <nEwLiNe>I think this confirms that the answer is correct. I used two different methods: iterative step-by-step computation and finding a closed-form formula using recurrence relations. Both methods led me to the same result, so I'm confident that 265,719 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute it one more time using the closed-form formula: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (3/2)*(3^{n+1} - 1) <nEwLiNe>For n=10: <nEwLiNe>a_10 = (3/2)*(3^{11} - 1) = (3/2)*(177147 - 1) = (3/2)*177146 <nEwLiNe>Compute 177146 * 3: <nEwLiNe>177,146 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 100,000 * 3 = 300,000 <nEwLiNe>- 70,000 * 3 = 210,000 <nEwLiNe>- 7,000 * 3 = 21,000 <nEwLiNe>- 100 * 3 = 300 <nEwLiNe>- 40 * 3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>- 6 * 3 = 18 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: <nEwLiNe>300,000 + 210,000 = 510,000 <nEwLiNe>510,000 + 21,000 = 531,000 <nEwLiNe>531,000 + 300 = 531,300 <nEwLiNe>531,300 + 120 = 531,420 <nEwLiNe>531,420 + 18 = 531,438 <nEwLiNe>Then, divide by 2: <nEwLiNe>531,438 / 2 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I think I'm confident that 265,719 is the correct answer. It was a bit tedious with all those layers, but breaking it down step by step and verifying with a formula helped solidify that the answer is correct. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The expression is computed by evaluating each nested layer step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses. Each layer involves multiplying 3 by the sum of 1 and the result of the previous layer. After computing each layer iteratively, the final result is found to be 265,719. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 265,719 <nEwLiNe>To solve the expression \( 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) \), we can break it down step by step by evaluating each layer starting from the innermost parentheses. <nEwLiNe>1.

 Hmm, okay, so maybe I can solve this by starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way outwards. That usually works with nested expressions. Let me try that approach. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost part: 1 + 3. That should be straightforward. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that part, the expression becomes: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me check that again. The innermost was the last (1 + 3), so replacing that with 4. Now, moving one step out, we have another (1 + 3(...)). So, the next layer is 1 + 3*(previous result). Let me write that down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote each step as Level 1 to Level 9, where Level 1 is the innermost and Level 9 is the outermost. <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the entire nested expression. So, actually, after computing Level 9, which is the outermost (1 + 3*(...)), we have to multiply that by 3. Let me clarify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me look again. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So, the outermost operation is multiplying by 3. So, actually, the structure is: <nEwLiNe>3*( [Level 9] ) <nEwLiNe>Where [Level 9] is (1 + 3*(...)), which we computed as 29524. So, the final result is 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check the levels because maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Looking back, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, counting the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: let's see. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then (1 + 3(...)), each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a level. Let's count how many times ""1 + 3(...)"" occurs. <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))  <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the first innermost is (1 + 3), then each subsequent layer adds another (1 + 3(...)). Let me count the number of nested parentheses: <nEwLiNe>Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3) at the very end. <nEwLiNe>2. Then moving out, each step adds another (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>So, the number of layers is 9. Because starting from the innermost, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3(...)) before we reach the outermost 3*(...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to Level 9 as 29524, and then multiplied by 3. But let me check if that is correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the outermost operation is 3*(Level 9). So, if Level 9 is 29524, then the total is 3*29524. Let me compute that. <nEwLiNe>3*29524: 29524 * 3. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, 29,524 *3=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that seems high, but let's see. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the levels. Let me recount the levels step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression with each level clearly: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level 1) = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level 2) = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level 3) = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level 4) = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level 5) = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level 6) = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level 7) = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level 8) = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*(Level 9) = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure that Level 9 is indeed the outermost (1 + 3*(...)). Because in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 nested (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe I miscounted the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me parse the expression step by step. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3). Then each step adds another layer. Let's count the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) -> Level 1: 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(Level1) inside next (1 + ...): 1 + 3*4=13 -> Level2 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(Level2) inside next (1 + ...):1 + 3*13=40 -> Level3 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(Level3):1 + 3*40=121 -> Level4 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(Level4):1 + 3*121=364 -> Level5 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(Level5):1 + 3*364=1093 -> Level6 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(Level6):1 + 3*1093=3280 -> Level7 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(Level7):1 + 3*3280=9841 -> Level8 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(Level8):1 + 3*9841=29524 -> Level9 <nEwLiNe>Then, the outermost is 3*(Level9): 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in the original expression, after the first 3, there are 8 layers of (1 + 3(...)). So, perhaps my Level1 is the innermost, and Level9 is the outermost. So, 3*(Level9) is the total. <nEwLiNe>But let me check: starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). So, each time we go out, we add another layer. So, with 8 layers, does that mean we have 8 levels? Wait, confusion arises because the first (1 + 3) is Level1, and then each subsequent layer adds another level. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps a better way is to count the number of 3s in the expression. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps I can recognize this as a geometric series or something similar. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, it's a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But let me confirm that a_9 is the correct outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), right? Because starting from the innermost (1 + 3), each step adds another layer, and the outermost is 3*(...). So, actually, there are 9 layers of (1 + 3*(...)), each nested within the previous one. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but when I counted the layers, I started from 1 + 3 as Level1, then each subsequent layer adds another Level, up to Level9. So, the outermost is 3*(Level9). So, yes, 3*29524 is correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_0 = 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, because the innermost term is 1 + 3, so perhaps a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>Then, the total expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, a_1 = 4 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 13 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 40 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 121 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 364 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>Thus, total = 3*29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to make sure, let me compute 3*29524 step by step. <nEwLiNe>29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>9,000 *3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>500*3=1,500 <nEwLiNe>24*3=72 <nEwLiNe>Adding them up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000 <nEwLiNe>87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500 <nEwLiNe>88,500 +72=88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 *3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>*        3 <nEwLiNe>--------- <nEwLiNe>Starting from the right: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7 <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8. <nEwLiNe>So, 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the levels, let me check the number of layers again. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) inside the next (1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(result of step 2) inside next (1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Continuing until the outermost. <nEwLiNe>So, how many times does ""1 + 3(...)"" occur? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each step adds another layer. So, the innermost is 1 layer, then each subsequent layer adds another, so with 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>But wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))) with 8 layers inside the first 3*(...). Wait, now I'm confused. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3. <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the first parenthesis is (1 + 3(...)), then each subsequent (1 + 3(...)) is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of (1 + 3(...)): <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Each time, the number increases. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the number of layers is 8, because after the first 3, there are 8 nested (1 + 3(...)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>The expression is 3 followed by (1 + 3(...)), and inside that, another (1 + 3(...)), and so on, until the innermost (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first 3, the number of nested (1 + 3(...)) is 8. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total number of layers is 8, meaning a_8. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but earlier, I computed up to a_9, which would correspond to 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to parse the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. The innermost is (1 + 3). <nEwLiNe>2. Then moving out, the next layer is (1 + 3*(innermost)). <nEwLiNe>3. Then the next layer is (1 + 3*(previous layer)). <nEwLiNe>Continuing this way, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression with indices: <nEwLiNe>Level 1: (1 + 3) = 4 <nEwLiNe>Level 2: 1 + 3*(Level1) = 13 <nEwLiNe>Level 3: 1 + 3*(Level2) = 40 <nEwLiNe>Level 4: 1 + 3*(Level3) = 121 <nEwLiNe>Level 5: 1 + 3*(Level4) = 364 <nEwLiNe>Level 6: 1 + 3*(Level5) = 1093 <nEwLiNe>Level 7: 1 + 3*(Level6) = 3280 <nEwLiNe>Level 8: 1 + 3*(Level7) = 9841 <nEwLiNe>Level 9: 1 + 3*(Level8) = 29524 <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, the outermost is 3*(Level9). So, 3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>But if I count the number of (1 + 3(...)) inside the first 3*(...), there are 8 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether the first 3 is considered a layer or not. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as a tree: the first 3 is the root, and each (1 + 3(...)) is a child node. <nEwLiNe>But regardless, the computation seems consistent: starting from the innermost, computing each layer step by step, and then multiplying the outermost result by 3. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>Given the recurrence relation a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1}, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence, which can be solved. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is a_n = A*3^n + B, where B is a constant. <nEwLiNe>To find B, we can solve for the steady-state solution. Setting a_n = a_{n-1} = B: <nEwLiNe>B = 1 + 3*B => B - 3B =1 => -2B=1 => B= -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, applying the initial condition a_1 =4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 -1/2 => 4 = 3A -1/2 => 3A = 4 +1/2 = 9/2 => A= (9/2)/3= 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the solution is a_n= (3/2)*3^n -1/2= (3^{n+1})/2 -1/2= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n= (3^{n+1} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, for a_9, n=9. <nEwLiNe>a_9= (3^{10} -1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10=59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9= (59049 -1)/2=59048/2=29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the total expression is 3*a_9=3*29524=88,572. <nEwLiNe>So, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me verify with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1= (3^{2}-1)/2=(9-1)/2=4, which is correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, a_2=(3^3 -1)/2=(27-1)/2=13, correct. <nEwLiNe>a_3=(81-1)/2=40, correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula holds. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, confident that a_9=29524, and total=88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Let me see... I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting lost.  <nEwLiNe>So, let me break it down. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12.  <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer out is 1 + 12. That gives me 13. Multiply that by 3, and I get 39. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, and then multiplying by 3. Let me write this out step by step to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Multiply by 3: 3 * 88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, hold on. Let me recount how many layers I have here. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many sets of parentheses? Let me check. Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...).  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is inside. So, how many times does 3(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:  <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) — that's the first 3. <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3(1 + 3(...)) — that's the second. <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing, each time, there's another 3(1 + ...).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 3*(previous result). So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each layer is built by multiplying by 3. So, how many times do I have to do this? Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: each "")))"" corresponds to a layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the original expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, then each layer adds another 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times ""3("" appears in the expression: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) — that's the first 3. <nEwLiNe>2. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) — second 3. <nEwLiNe>3. Then, 3(1 + 3(...)) — third 3. <nEwLiNe>4. Continuing, each time another 3(1 + ...). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, each time, it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus another 3(...)). So, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Let me see: the innermost is 1 + 3, then each time we go out, we have a 3*(...). So, how many multiplications by 3 are there? Let's count the number of 3's before a parenthesis: <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3 is outside: 3(1 + ... <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3(1 + ... <nEwLiNe>3. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of 3( in the expression: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3( is 9. Because each ""3("" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse it: <nEwLiNe>- The first 3 is the outermost: 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Then, inside, another 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>- Each time, it's 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each step out adds another 3*(...). So, how many layers is that? <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses. So, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, 9 closing parentheses mean 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of operations is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 20 steps. That seems off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Next layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Next layer: 3*(88573) = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, and each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times 1 + 3(...) appears: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the innermost, 1 + 3, and each layer out adds another 3(...). So, the number of layers is 9, because each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a new layer, and there are 9 sets of parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me think differently. The expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ... + 3))). So, each time, it's 3*(1 + ...). The number of 3* is equal to the number of layers. Let me count the number of 3*: <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Each ""3("" is a new multiplication. So, starting from the first 3, then inside, another 3, and so on until the innermost 3(1 + 3). So, how many 3('s are there? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>10. 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, the number of 3('s is 9. Because starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside. So, 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier computation, I ended up with 20 steps. That must be incorrect because 9 layers should only require 9 computations. Wait, maybe I'm confusing layers with steps. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is a pair of parentheses, so starting from the innermost, we have 9 layers. Therefore, the computation should involve 9 multiplications by 3 and 9 additions of 1. So, 9 layers, each requiring two operations: add 1, multiply by 3. But since we start from the innermost, it's actually 9 layers, each computed in order. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial step-by-step was correct, but I miscounted the number of layers. Let me recount: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Layer 10: 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Layer 11: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Layer 12: 3*(1093) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Layer 13: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Layer 14: 3*(3280) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Layer 15: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Layer 16: 3*(9841) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Layer 17: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Layer 18: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Layer 19: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Layer 20: 3*(88573) = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm confused because if the expression has 9 layers, why am I computing up to layer 20? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I miscounted the layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps each layer is a multiplication by 3 and an addition of 1. So, each layer corresponds to two operations: adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, starting from the innermost, each layer is one addition and one multiplication. <nEwLiNe>But in reality, starting from the innermost, each layer is a single operation: 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is one multiplication by 3 after adding 1 to the previous result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think of it as a recursive sequence. Let me define a function f(n) where n is the number of layers. Then, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). The base case is f(1) = 3*(1 + 3) = 12? Wait, no. Wait, if n=1, it's just 3*(1 + 3) = 12. But in our case, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, then multiplied by 3 to get 12. So, perhaps f(1) = 4, and f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try that. Let me define: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + f(1)) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my earlier step-by-step, I had f(2) = 12. Hmm, that's conflicting. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, it's 1 + 3, which is 4. Then, moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4) = 15. Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + 15 = 16, then 3*16 = 48, etc. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my initial computation, I started with 1 + 3 = 4, then 3*4 = 12, then 1 + 12 = 13, then 3*13 = 39, etc. So, that's alternating between adding 1 and multiplying by 3. But perhaps that's the right way. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps each layer is: starting from the innermost, compute 1 + 3, then multiply by 3, then add 1, then multiply by 3, etc. So, each layer consists of an addition and a multiplication. Therefore, for each layer beyond the innermost, we have two operations: add 1, multiply by 3. <nEwLiNe>But in the expression, each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1 to the inner expression. Therefore, each layer is a single operation: 3*(1 + inner). So, if we have 9 layers, we have 9 operations of multiplying by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>a_10 = 3*(1 + a_9) = 3*(1 + 88572) = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the original expression, how many a's do we have? If the innermost is 1 + 3 = 4, then a_1 is 3*(1 + 3) = 12, and so on. So, if the original expression has 9 layers, then a_9 would be the final result. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: the original expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). So, the number of layers is 9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_1 corresponds to the innermost layer: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 corresponds to the next layer: 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3: 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>a_4: 3*(1 + a_3) = 363 <nEwLiNe>a_5: 1092 <nEwLiNe>a_6: 3279 <nEwLiNe>a_7: 9840 <nEwLiNe>a_8: 29523 <nEwLiNe>a_9: 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 is the result of the original expression. Therefore, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, in my initial step-by-step, I went up to a_10 = 265,719, but that's because I miscounted the layers. The original expression has 9 layers, so a_9 is the answer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but let me verify this. Let's write out the expression with 9 layers: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, so the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me make sure. Let me write the entire expression with the computed values: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, now I'm getting confused again. Is the innermost 1 + 3 considered layer 1, and then each subsequent layer adds another multiplication? So, if I have 9 layers, I should have 9 multiplications. But in the above list, I have 10 steps. Hmm. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in whether the innermost is considered layer 1 or layer 0. Let me clarify: <nEwLiNe>If I consider the innermost expression as the starting point, which is 1 + 3 = 4, then the first multiplication is 3*4 = 12. Then, moving out, each subsequent layer adds 1 and multiplies by 3. So, each layer after the innermost is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, if there are 9 layers, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and then each of the 9 layers is a multiplication by 3. So, total operations: 9 multiplications and 9 additions. But in reality, starting from the innermost, each layer is a multiplication by 3, so 9 multiplications. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think differently. Let me model this as a geometric series. <nEwLiNe>Each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). So, it's similar to 3 + 3^2 + 3^3 + ... + 3^n, but not exactly. Wait, no. Let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). This is a form of a geometric progression, but each term is multiplied by 3 and added to 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, this is similar to the expansion of (3)^n - 1, but I need to verify. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me think recursively. Let me denote the entire expression as E. <nEwLiNe>Then, E = 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + ...))). But inside E, the inner expression is similar to E itself, but one layer less. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, no. Let me define E_n as the expression with n layers. <nEwLiNe>Then, E_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>E_2 = 3*(1 + E_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>E_3 = 3*(1 + E_2) = 120 <nEwLiNe>E_4 = 363 <nEwLiNe>E_5 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>E_6 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>E_7 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>E_8 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>E_9 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, E_9 is the value of the original expression, which is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. 3 * 88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm getting 265,719 as the result, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion of 88,572. Clearly, there's a confusion in the number of layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's parse the original expression again: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of 3( in the expression: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left: <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) — that's the first 3( <nEwLiNe>2. Then, inside, another 3(1 + 3(...)) — second 3( <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing, each time another 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>So, how many 3('s are there? Let's count: <nEwLiNe>The expression is: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Let's count the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>10. 3 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on. Let me parse it as a string: <nEwLiNe>""3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))"" <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>- The first character is '3', followed by '(', so that's the first 3( <nEwLiNe>- Then, inside, after '1 + ', we have another '3(', so that's the second 3( <nEwLiNe>- Continuing, each time after '1 + ', we have another '3(' <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the first '3(', each subsequent '3(' is inside the previous parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Let me count them: <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's 9 ""3("" in total. The last one is at the innermost part: 3(1 + 3). So, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the expression has 9 layers, each corresponding to a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computation should be: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 265,719, which is incorrect because I continued beyond 9 layers. That was a mistake. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>To double-check, let's compute it step by step: <nEwLiNe>Start with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 13 * 3 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 40 * 3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 121 * 3 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 364 * 3 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 1093 * 3 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3280 * 3 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 9841 * 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, now I'm getting 88,572 as the result after 18 steps. But according to the layer count, it should be 9 layers, but here I have 18 steps. Each layer involves two steps: adding 1 and multiplying by 3. So, 9 layers correspond to 18 steps. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final result is indeed 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But to confirm, let's see: <nEwLiNe>After 9 layers, which correspond to 18 steps, we reach 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check this with a different approach. Let me model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a_n as the value after n layers. <nEwLiNe>Given that a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>And so on, up to a_9. <nEwLiNe>We can see that each a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let's solve it. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3, with a_1 = 12. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3 <nEwLiNe>This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>We can solve this recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, find the homogeneous solution. The homogeneous equation is a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is C*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the non-homogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant A. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: A = 3*A + 3 <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: A - 3A = 3 => -2A = 3 => A = -3/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = homogeneous + particular = C*3^n - 3/2 <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1 = 12. <nEwLiNe>So, 12 = C*3^1 - 3/2 => 12 = 3C - 1.5 => 3C = 13.5 => C = 4.5 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = 4.5*3^n - 1.5 <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (9/2)*3^n - 3/2 = (9*3^n - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>So, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (3^{10} - 3)/2 <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (59049 - 3)/2 = 59046/2 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's conflicting with our earlier result. According to this, a_9 = 29,523, but earlier we computed a_9 as 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, this suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the definition of n. <nEwLiNe>Wait, in the recurrence, we defined a_n as the value after n layers. But in the recurrence, a_1 corresponds to the first multiplication, which is 3*(1 + 3) = 12. Then a_2 is 3*(1 + a_1) = 39, etc., up to a_9 = 29,523. <nEwLiNe>But in the original expression, we have 9 layers, starting from the innermost 1 + 3, which would correspond to a_1 = 12, and then a_2 = 39, up to a_9 = 29,523. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when computing step by step, I ended up with 88,572 after 9 layers, which seems contradictory. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, the outermost layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost is 1 + 3, which is a_1 = 4, but in our recurrence, a_1 is 12, which is 3*(1 + 3). So, perhaps the indexing is shifted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me redefine. Let me define a_0 as the innermost expression: a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, a_1 = 3*(1 + a_0) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this seems different from before. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no. Let me try to redefine the recurrence correctly. <nEwLiNe>If we consider the innermost expression as a_0 = 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, each subsequent layer is a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_1 = 3*(1 + a_0) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but this is still conflicting with the earlier results. <nEwLiNe>I think the confusion arises from how we index the layers. If we consider the innermost expression as a_0, then the outermost layer is a_9, which would be 108,255. But according to the step-by-step computation earlier, the result was 88,572. So, which one is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps my initial step-by-step was wrong because I considered the innermost as layer 1, but according to the recurrence, if a_0 is the innermost, then a_9 is the outermost. Let's see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's try to compute the expression step by step, considering the innermost as the first step: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3*(1 + 36084) = 108255 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so if we have 10 layers, the result is 108,255. But according to the original expression, how many layers do we have? <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Count the number of 3('s: 9. <nEwLiNe>But in the step-by-step above, with a_0 as innermost, we have 10 layers to reach the outermost. Therefore, the original expression has 9 layers, starting from the innermost as layer 1. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the confusion is in whether the innermost is considered layer 1 or layer 0. <nEwLiNe>If we consider the innermost as layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>Then, layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15 <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48 <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147 <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444 <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335 <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008 <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027 <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, with the innermost as layer 1, the outermost layer is layer 9, which is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I computed step-by-step from the innermost, I ended up with 88,572 after 9 layers. So, which is correct? <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps the indexing is the issue. Let me try to compute the expression as per the original structure. <nEwLiNe>The original expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>10. 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so here, starting from the innermost, each step is a multiplication by 3. So, step 1: innermost addition, step 2: first multiplication, step 3: second multiplication, etc. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, after 9 multiplications, we reach the outermost layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in this computation, step 1 is 1 + 3 = 4, step 2 is 3*4 = 12, step 3 is 3*(1 + 12) = 39, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the number of multiplications is 9, resulting in the final value of 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the correct answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But earlier, when I tried the recurrence relation, I got a different result because I misaligned the layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The result of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Explanation:** <nEwLiNe>1. **Identify the Structure:** The given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...). There are 9 layers in total. <nEwLiNe>2. **Start from the Innermost Layer:** <nEwLiNe>   - Innermost layer: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>3. **Compute Each Layer Step-by-Step:** <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 1: 3*(1 + 3) = 3*4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 2: 3*(1 + 12) = 3*13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 3: 3*(1 + 39) = 3*40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 4: 3*(1 + 120) = 3*121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 5: 3*(1 + 363) = 3*364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 6: 3*(1 + 1092) = 3*1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 7: 3*(1 + 3279) = 3*3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 8: 3*(1 + 9840) = 3*9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>   - Layer 9: 3*(1 + 29523) = 3*29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>4. **Final Result:** After computing all 9 layers, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** 88,572 <nEwLiNe>Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something).  <nEwLiNe>Let me see... I think the best way to approach this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting lost.  <nEwLiNe>So, let me break it down. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's straightforward: 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12.  <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer out is 1 + 12. That gives me 13. Multiply that by 3, and I get 39. Hmm, okay, so each time I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, and then multiplying by 3. Let me write this out step by step to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Multiply by 3: 3 * 88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, hold on. Let me recount how many layers I have here. The original expression is 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) with how many sets of parentheses? Let me check. Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, then each subsequent layer adds another 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Looking back at the original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Let me count the number of 3(1 + ...).  <nEwLiNe>Starting from the left, the first 3 is outside, then each subsequent 3 is inside. So, how many times does 3(1 + ...) occur? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after each 3:  <nEwLiNe>1. 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(...))) — that's the first 3. <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, another 3(1 + 3(...)) — that's the second 3. <nEwLiNe>3. Continuing, each time, there's another 3(1 + ...).  <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each time it's 3 multiplied by (1 plus something). So, starting from the innermost, each step is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is built by multiplying by 3. So, how many layers are there? <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, starting from the innermost, each subsequent layer adds another 3(...). Let me count the number of times ""3("" appears in the expression: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of 3( is 9. Because each ""3("" is a new layer. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of operations is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 20 steps. That seems off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Next layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Next layer: 3*(88573) = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each layer out adds another 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of closing parentheses at the end: the expression ends with 9 closing parentheses. So, each closing parenthesis corresponds to a layer. So, 9 closing parentheses mean 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but starting from the innermost, each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, the number of operations is equal to the number of layers, which is 9. Wait, but in my earlier computation, I went up to 20 steps. That seems off. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me write the expression step by step, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3*(4) = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer: 3*(13) = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 3*(40) = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Next layer: 3*(121) = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 3*(364) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Next layer: 3*(1093) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 3*(3280) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Next layer: 3*(9841) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Next layer: 3*(29524) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>19. Next layer: 1 + 88572 = 88573 <nEwLiNe>20. Next layer: 3*(88573) = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait, but according to the original expression, how many layers are there? Each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, and each layer out adds another 3(...).  <nEwLiNe>Let me count the number of times ""1 +"" appears in the expression: <nEwLiNe>Original expression: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>So, the number of ""1 +"" is 9. Because each ""1 +"" is followed by another 3(...). So, 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computation should involve 9 layers, each corresponding to a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, the final result should be after 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>But in my earlier step-by-step, I ended up with 20 steps. That must be incorrect because 9 layers should only require 9 computations. Wait, maybe I'm confusing layers with steps. <nEwLiNe>Wait, each layer is a multiplication by 3 after adding 1. So, each layer requires two operations: add 1, multiply by 3. Therefore, for 9 layers, we have 18 operations. <nEwLiNe>But in my step-by-step, I have 20 steps, which suggests I might have miscounted. Let me recount carefully. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: 4 * 3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 13 * 3 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 40 * 3 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 121 * 3 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 364 * 3 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 1093 * 3 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3280 * 3 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 9841 * 3 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, after 18 steps, which correspond to 9 layers, the final result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>To double-check, let's model this as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence where each term is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let a_1 = 3*(1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3*(1 + a_1) = 3*(1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3*(1 + a_2) = 3*(1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3*(1 + a_3) = 3*(1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3*(1 + a_4) = 3*(1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3*(1 + a_5) = 3*(1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3*(1 + a_6) = 3*(1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3*(1 + a_7) = 3*(1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3*(1 + a_8) = 3*(1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, the result is 88,572, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The result of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Step-by-Step Explanation:** <nEwLiNe>1. **Identify the Structure:** The given expression is a nested structure where each layer is of the form 3*(1 + ...).

Man, that's a lot of parentheses! It looks like each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). I think the best way to tackle this is to start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That way, I can compute each layer step by step without getting lost. <nEwLiNe>Okay, let's break it down. The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's simple enough: 1 + 3 equals 4. Then, moving one layer out, we have 3 times that result. So, 3 * 4 equals 12. Got it. <nEwLiNe>Now, the next layer out is 1 + 12. That gives me 13. Multiply that by 3, and I get 39. Hmm, so each time I'm taking the previous result, adding 1, and then multiplying by 3. Let me write this out step by step to keep track. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Next layer: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10.

Multiply by 3: 3 * 88573 = 265,719 <nEwLiNe>Wait a second, that seems like a lot of steps—20 steps for what looks like 9 layers. Maybe I'm miscounting the layers. Let me check the original expression again: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\).  <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""3("" in the expression, I see there are 9 instances. So, there should be 9 layers. That means I must have made a mistake in my earlier step-by-step because I ended up with 20 steps, which doesn't align with 9 layers. <nEwLiNe>Let me try again, this time carefully counting the layers: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Multiply by 3: 3 * 4 = 12 <nEwLiNe>3. Next layer: 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Multiply by 3: 3 * 13 = 39 <nEwLiNe>5. Next layer: 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3: 3 * 40 = 120 <nEwLiNe>7. Next layer: 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Multiply by 3: 3 * 121 = 363 <nEwLiNe>9. Next layer: 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Multiply by 3: 3 * 364 = 1092 <nEwLiNe>11. Next layer: 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Multiply by 3: 3 * 1093 = 3279 <nEwLiNe>13. Next layer: 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Multiply by 3: 3 * 3280 = 9840 <nEwLiNe>15. Next layer: 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Multiply by 3: 3 * 9841 = 29523 <nEwLiNe>17. Next layer: 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>18. Multiply by 3: 3 * 29524 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, after 18 steps, which correspond to 9 layers, the final result is 88,572. Phew! That makes more sense. <nEwLiNe>To double-check, let's model this as a recurrence relation. Let's define a sequence where each term is computed as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let a_1 = 3 * (1 + 3) = 12 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 3 * (1 + a_1) = 3 * (1 + 12) = 39 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 3 * (1 + a_2) = 3 * (1 + 39) = 120 <nEwLiNe>a_4 = 3 * (1 + a_3) = 3 * (1 + 120) = 363 <nEwLiNe>a_5 = 3 * (1 + a_4) = 3 * (1 + 363) = 1092 <nEwLiNe>a_6 = 3 * (1 + a_5) = 3 * (1 + 1092) = 3279 <nEwLiNe>a_7 = 3 * (1 + a_6) = 3 * (1 + 3279) = 9840 <nEwLiNe>a_8 = 3 * (1 + a_7) = 3 * (1 + 9840) = 29523 <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 3 * (1 + a_8) = 3 * (1 + 29523) = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, after 9 layers, the result is 88,572, which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the final answer is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The result of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, let me try to break this down. Maybe if I start from the innermost part and work my way outwards. That usually helps with these kinds of expressions. So, the innermost part is (1 + 3). Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. Compute the innermost parentheses: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Then, moving one layer out, we have 1 + 3*(result from step 1). So, that would be 1 + 3*4 <nEwLiNe>3. Let me compute that: 3*4 is 12, so 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>4. Next layer out: 1 + 3*(result from step 3). So, 1 + 3*13 <nEwLiNe>5. Calculating that: 3*13 = 39, so 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>6. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 5). So, 1 + 3*40 <nEwLiNe>7. 3*40 is 120, so 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>8. Moving out another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 7). So, 1 + 3*121 <nEwLiNe>9. Calculating that: 3*121 = 363, so 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>10. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 9). So, 1 + 3*364 <nEwLiNe>11. 3*364 is 1092, so 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>12. Another layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 11). So, 1 + 3*1093 <nEwLiNe>13. Calculating: 3*1093 = 3279, so 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>14. Next layer: 1 + 3*(result from step 13). So, 1 + 3*3280 <nEwLiNe>15. 3*3280 is 9840, so 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>16. Finally, the outermost layer: 3*(result from step 15). So, 3*9841 <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, let me double-check how many layers there are. The original expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (1 + 3 times ... )). Each ""1 + 3(...)"" is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3.  <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of layers: Each ""1+3(...)"" is a layer. Starting from the innermost, each time you have one more layer. So, let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. Innermost: (1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>2. Next: (1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>3. Then another, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression, I think there are 9 layers of ""1 + 3(...)"", each nested inside the previous one. So, starting from the innermost, each time we compute one layer and substitute it into the next outer layer. <nEwLiNe>So, let me try to recount the steps with that in mind. <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>10. Finally, the outermost multiplication: 3*29524 <nEwLiNe>Wait, so in my initial counting, I stopped at step 16, which was the outermost layer. But if there are 9 layers, then after computing the 9th layer, we have to multiply by 3 at the very end. <nEwLiNe>So, let me correct that: <nEwLiNe>1. Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4 <nEwLiNe>2. Layer 2: 1 + 3*4 = 13 <nEwLiNe>3. Layer 3: 1 + 3*13 = 40 <nEwLiNe>4. Layer 4: 1 + 3*40 = 121 <nEwLiNe>5. Layer 5: 1 + 3*121 = 364 <nEwLiNe>6. Layer 6: 1 + 3*364 = 1093 <nEwLiNe>7. Layer 7: 1 + 3*1093 = 3280 <nEwLiNe>8. Layer 8: 1 + 3*3280 = 9841 <nEwLiNe>9. Layer 9: 1 + 3*9841 = 29524 <nEwLiNe>So, after computing the innermost 9 layers, we get 29524. Then, the entire expression is 3 multiplied by this result. So, 3*29524. <nEwLiNe>Calculating that: 29524 * 3. Let me compute this. <nEwLiNe>29524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>First, 20000*3 = 60000 <nEwLiNe>Then, 9000*3 = 27000 <nEwLiNe>500*3 = 1500 <nEwLiNe>20*3 = 60 <nEwLiNe>4*3 = 12 <nEwLiNe>Adding them together: <nEwLiNe>60000 + 27000 = 87000 <nEwLiNe>87000 + 1500 = 88500 <nEwLiNe>88500 + 60 = 88560 <nEwLiNe>88560 + 12 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>So, 29524 * 3 = 88572 <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the entire expression is 88572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me verify this step by step because it's easy to make a mistake with so many layers. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for this kind of expression. It seems like each layer is of the form 1 + 3*(previous layer). So, starting from 1, each time we do 1 + 3*(something). If I denote each layer as a_n, then a_1 = 1 + 3, a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1, and so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, in the expression, the innermost is 1 + 3, then each layer is 1 + 3*(previous). So, perhaps it's a geometric series? <nEwLiNe>Let me think. Let me define a_n as follows: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>a_2 = 1 + 3*a_1 <nEwLiNe>a_3 = 1 + 3*a_2 <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>a_9 = 1 + 3*a_8 <nEwLiNe>Then, the entire expression is 3*a_9. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 1 + 3 times the previous term. So, starting from a_1 = 4, each subsequent term is 1 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, maybe we can find a closed-form formula for a_n. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. Let me recall how to solve such recursions. <nEwLiNe>The general form is a_n = c + r*a_{n-1} <nEwLiNe>In this case, c = 1 and r = 3. <nEwLiNe>The solution to such a recurrence is a_n = (a_0 - c/(1 - r)) * r^n + c/(1 - r) <nEwLiNe>But wait, in our case, a_1 = 4, so let me adjust the indices. <nEwLiNe>Wait, maybe it's better to write the recurrence as a_n = 1 + 3*a_{n-1} with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, solving the recurrence relation a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 1, with a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_p. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: a_p = 3*a_p + 1. <nEwLiNe>Solving for a_p: a_p - 3*a_p = 1 => -2*a_p = 1 => a_p = -1/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 4 = A*3^1 - 1/2 => 4 = 3A - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: 3A = 4 + 1/2 = 9/2 => A = (9/2)/3 = 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general solution is a_n = (3/2)*3^n - 1/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: a_n = (3^{n+1})/2 - 1/2 = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with n=1: a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: a_2 = (3^3 -1)/2 = (27 -1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>n=3: (81 -1)/2=80/2=40. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: (243 -1)/2=242/2=121. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the formula works. Therefore, a_n = (3^{n+1} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>In our problem, we have 9 layers, so n=9. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^{10}: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683, 3^{10}=59049. <nEwLiNe>So, a_9 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524. <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is 3*a_9 = 3*29524 = 88572. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute 3^{10} again: <nEwLiNe>3^1=3 <nEwLiNe>3^2=9 <nEwLiNe>3^3=27 <nEwLiNe>3^4=81 <nEwLiNe>3^5=243 <nEwLiNe>3^6=729 <nEwLiNe>3^7=2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8=6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9=19683 <nEwLiNe>3^{10}=59049. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, 59049 -1 =59048, divided by 2 is 29524. <nEwLiNe>Multiply by 3: 29524*3. <nEwLiNe>Compute 29524*3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x     3 <nEwLiNe>---------- <nEwLiNe>Let's compute digit by digit: <nEwLiNe>4*3=12, write down 2, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +1=7, write down 7. <nEwLiNe>5*3=15, write down 5, carryover 1. <nEwLiNe>9*3=27 +1=28, write down 8, carryover 2. <nEwLiNe>2*3=6 +2=8, write down 8. <nEwLiNe>So, the result is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>+29,524 <nEwLiNe>+29,524 <nEwLiNe>= ? <nEwLiNe>29,524 +29,524=59,048 <nEwLiNe>59,048 +29,524=88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. <nEwLiNe>So, I can confidently say the value is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the computed value is 88572. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>The value of the expression is \boxed{88572}. <nEwLiNe>"

 Let me see if I can break this down step by step. Maybe I can start from the innermost parentheses and work my way outwards. That usually seems to be the best approach with nested expressions.  <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3, right? Let me write that down: <nEwLiNe>First layer: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, moving out one layer, we have another 3 times that result. So the next layer is 3*(first layer).  <nEwLiNe>Second layer: 3*(4) = 12. <nEwLiNe>Then, moving out another layer, it's 1 + that result. <nEwLiNe>Third layer: 1 + 12 = 13. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. So each time, it's 1 plus the previous layer, multiplied by 3? Hmm, no, actually, each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So maybe I was a bit confused earlier. <nEwLiNe>Let me clarify the structure. The entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(...))). So each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So starting from the innermost, which is 1 + 3, but wait, no. The innermost is just 1 + 3, which is 4. Then moving out, it's 3*(1 + 4). Then the next layer is 1 + 3*(1 + 4). Wait, no, let me see. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, the innermost expression is 1 + 3. Then, moving out, each layer is 3*(1 + previous result). So let me try again. <nEwLiNe>Let me number the layers from inside out, starting with layer 1 as the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, is that correct? Because the expression is 3*(1 + 3*(...)), so each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So actually, starting from the innermost, each layer is 3*(1 + next layer). So, perhaps I should define each layer as follows: <nEwLiNe>Let me denote the layers starting from the innermost as Layer 1, then Layer 2, up to Layer 9, since there are 9 sets of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the beginning: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))\). So, each ""1+"" is followed by a 3 and another parenthesis. Let me count the number of 3s: 3( ... ) where each ... is another 3(...). So how many 3s are there? Let's see: <nEwLiNe>Breaking it down: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of 3s: 3( ... ), then inside that, another 3(...), and so on. Let me see, each opening parenthesis corresponds to a 3, so starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested inside. <nEwLiNe>So, how many layers are there? Let me see: starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside. So: <nEwLiNe>First 3: 3(1 + ...) <nEwLiNe>Second 3: inside the first, so 3(1 + 3(...)) <nEwLiNe>Third 3: inside the second, etc. <nEwLiNe>So, how many 3s are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Each ""3("" is a new layer. Let's see: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of ""3("": <nEwLiNe>1. 3( <nEwLiNe>2. 3( <nEwLiNe>3. 3( <nEwLiNe>4. 3( <nEwLiNe>5. 3( <nEwLiNe>6. 3( <nEwLiNe>7. 3( <nEwLiNe>8. 3( <nEwLiNe>9. 3( <nEwLiNe>So, there are 9 layers of 3s, each nested inside the previous one. So that means we have 9 layers to compute, starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, let's define Layer 1 as the innermost expression, which is 1 + 3. <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, Layer 2 is 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3 is 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4 is 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5 is 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6 is 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7 is 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8 is 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9 is 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait a minute, is that right? So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from Layer 1: 4, then Layer 2: 15, Layer 3: 48, Layer 4: 147, Layer 5: 444, Layer 6: 1335, Layer 7: 4008, Layer 8: 12027, Layer 9: 36084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the entire expression is Layer 9, which is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me double-check these calculations step by step, because it's easy to make an arithmetic mistake. <nEwLiNe>Starting over: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. Hmm, 445*3: 400*3=1200, 45*3=135, so 1200+135=1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. So 3000 + 900 = 3900, +90=3990, +18=4008. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Compute 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27, so total is 12027. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let's compute that. 12028*3: 10000*3=30000, 2000*3=6000, 28*3=84. So adding up: 30000 + 6000 = 36000, +84=36084. So that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or formula that can be used here instead of computing each layer manually, which could help verify the result. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the layers, each layer n is defined as 3*(1 + layer n-1). So this is a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Starting from layer 1: 4. <nEwLiNe>So, let's see if we can find a closed-form formula for this recursion. <nEwLiNe>Let me denote a_n as the value of layer n. So, <nEwLiNe>a_1 = 4, <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) for n > 1. <nEwLiNe>So, the recurrence relation is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, that's because 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}. <nEwLiNe>So, it's a linear recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, write the recurrence as: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation: <nEwLiNe>a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0. <nEwLiNe>The characteristic equation is r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Therefore, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n, where A is a constant. <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is a constant (3), we can assume a particular solution is a constant, say C. <nEwLiNe>Plugging into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>C - 3*C = 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2). <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition to find A. When n = 1, a_1 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2) => 4 = 3A - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Solving for A: <nEwLiNe>3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2 => A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general formula is: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>We can factor out 3^n: <nEwLiNe>a_n = 3^n*(11/6) - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, write 11/6 as (11/6) and 3/2 as (9/6): <nEwLiNe>a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>So, a_n = (11*3^n - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Let me test this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>a_1 = (11*3^1 - 9)/6 = (33 - 9)/6 = 24/6 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>a_2 = (11*9 - 9)/6 = (99 - 9)/6 = 90/6 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>a_3 = (11*27 - 9)/6 = (297 - 9)/6 = 288/6 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>a_4 = (11*81 - 9)/6 = (891 - 9)/6 = 882/6 = 147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9: <nEwLiNe>a_9 = (11*3^9 - 9)/6. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*19683 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>19683 * 10 = 196,830 <nEwLiNe>19683 * 1 = 19,683 <nEwLiNe>So, 196,830 + 19,683 = 216,513. <nEwLiNe>Then, subtract 9: 216,513 - 9 = 216,504. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 6: 216,504 / 6. <nEwLiNe>Compute that: <nEwLiNe>6 into 21 is 3, remainder 3. <nEwLiNe>6 into 36 (bring down 6) is 6. <nEwLiNe>6 into 50 (bring down 5) is 8, remainder 2. <nEwLiNe>6 into 24 (bring down 4) is 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, a_9 = 36,084, which matches our earlier step-by-step computation. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, thinking about the problem, since each layer is 3*(1 + previous), it's a geometric progression multiplied by some factor. But in this case, the closed-form formula we derived gives the same result as the step-by-step computation, so I can be confident that 36,084 is the correct answer. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"

 Okay, let me see. Maybe I can start simplifying from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems logical because each parenthesis depends on the one inside it. <nEwLiNe>So, the innermost part is 1 + 3. Let me compute that first. 1 + 3 is 4. So, replacing that, the expression becomes 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, hold on. Let me make sure. The innermost is 1 + 3, which is 4, and that's inside the last set of parentheses. So, the next layer out is 1 + 3(4). Let me compute that. 3 times 4 is 12, and then 1 + 12 is 13. So, replacing that, the expression becomes 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))))\). <nEwLiNe>Hmm, this is going to take a while. Let me see if I can find a pattern here or maybe a recursive formula. Each time, it's 3 times (1 + something). So, if I denote each layer as a term in a sequence, maybe I can express it recursively. <nEwLiNe>Let me define a sequence \( a_n \) where \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), then \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \), \( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 \), and so on, up to \( a_9 \), since there are nine layers of parentheses. <nEwLiNe>Wait, is that right? Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the outermost, each layer adds another parenthesis. Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Starting from the inside: <nEwLiNe>1. 1 + 3 <nEwLiNe>2. 1 + 3(1 + 3) <nEwLiNe>3. 1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)) <nEwLiNe>... <nEwLiNe>Up to the ninth layer. <nEwLiNe>So, actually, there are nine layers of 1 + 3(...). So, maybe I have \( a_1 = 1 + 3 \), \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \), and so on up to \( a_9 \). Then, the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \). Hmm, but in the original expression, it's 3 times (1 + 3(...)), so that would correspond to \( a_1 = 1 + 3 \), \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 \), etc., and the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, looking again: the expression is 3 times (1 + 3 times (...)), so maybe the number of layers is 9, each with a 3 multiplier. So, perhaps it's better to think of it as a recurrence relation. <nEwLiNe>Let me try to compute each layer step by step. <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost: <nEwLiNe>1. \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \) <nEwLiNe>2. \( a_2 = 1 + 3a_1 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \) <nEwLiNe>3. \( a_3 = 1 + 3a_2 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \) <nEwLiNe>4. \( a_4 = 1 + 3a_3 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \) <nEwLiNe>5. \( a_5 = 1 + 3a_4 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \) <nEwLiNe>6. \( a_6 = 1 + 3a_5 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \) <nEwLiNe>7. \( a_7 = 1 + 3a_6 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \) <nEwLiNe>8. \( a_8 = 1 + 3a_7 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \) <nEwLiNe>9. \( a_9 = 1 + 3a_8 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \) <nEwLiNe>So, \( a_9 = 29524 \). Then, the entire expression is 3 times \( a_9 \), right? Wait, no. Wait, the original expression is 3 times (1 + 3(...)), which is 3 times \( a_1 \). Wait, hold on, maybe I miscounted. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, let's see. The original expression is 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by (1 + 3 multiplied by ... )). So, if we define each inner expression as \( a_n \), starting from the innermost, which is \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), then each subsequent layer is \( a_{n} = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \). <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the outermost layer is 3 times \( a_9 \). So, yes, the total expression is 3 * \( a_9 \). <nEwLiNe>Wait, but in my previous computation, I have \( a_9 = 29524 \). Therefore, the total expression is 3 * 29524. Let me compute that: 29524 * 3. 29,524 * 3: 20,000 * 3 = 60,000; 9,000 * 3 = 27,000; 500 * 3 = 1,500; 24 * 3 = 72. So, adding those together: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but hold on a second, let me verify my step-by-step computation because 3*29524 is indeed 88,572, but I want to make sure that \( a_9 = 29524 \) is correct. <nEwLiNe>Let me recount each step: <nEwLiNe>1. \( a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>2. \( a_2 = 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>3. \( a_3 = 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>4. \( a_4 = 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>5. \( a_5 = 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>6. \( a_6 = 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>7. \( a_7 = 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>8. \( a_8 = 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>9. \( a_9 = 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>Okay, so each step seems correct. Therefore, \( a_9 = 29524 \) is accurate. Then, multiplying by 3 gives 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But wait, let me check my arithmetic in the last step again because 3 times 29,524. Let me compute 29,524 * 3: <nEwLiNe>- 20,000 * 3 = 60,000 <nEwLiNe>- 9,000 * 3 = 27,000 <nEwLiNe>- 500 * 3 = 1,500 <nEwLiNe>- 24 * 3 = 72 <nEwLiNe>Adding up: 60,000 + 27,000 = 87,000; 87,000 + 1,500 = 88,500; 88,500 + 72 = 88,572. Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can compute 29,524 * 3 directly: <nEwLiNe>29,524 <nEwLiNe>x     3 <nEwLiNe>------- <nEwLiNe>88,572 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. <nEwLiNe>So, the total expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a formula for the recurrence relation instead of computing each term step by step. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \), with \( a_1 = 4 \). This is a linear recurrence, and we can solve it to find a closed-form expression. <nEwLiNe>The general solution for such a recurrence is \( a_n = A \cdot 3^{n} + B \), where A and B are constants determined by the initial condition. <nEwLiNe>Given \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \), we can write the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. <nEwLiNe>First, solve the homogeneous equation \( a_n - 3a_{n-1} = 0 \). The characteristic equation is \( r - 3 = 0 \), so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is \( a_n^{(h)} = C \cdot 3^{n} \). <nEwLiNe>Next, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (1), we can try a constant particular solution \( a_n^{(p)} = K \). <nEwLiNe>Substituting into the recurrence: <nEwLiNe>\( K = 1 + 3K \) <nEwLiNe>Solving for K: <nEwLiNe>\( K - 3K = 1 \) <nEwLiNe>\( -2K = 1 \) <nEwLiNe>\( K = -1/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = C \cdot 3^{n} - 1/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition. When n = 1, \( a_1 = 4 \). <nEwLiNe>So, <nEwLiNe>\( 4 = C \cdot 3^{1} - 1/2 \) <nEwLiNe>\( 4 = 3C - 1/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Add 1/2 to both sides: <nEwLiNe>\( 4 + 1/2 = 3C \) <nEwLiNe>\( 9/2 = 3C \) <nEwLiNe>Divide both sides by 3: <nEwLiNe>\( C = (9/2) / 3 = 3/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the closed-form solution is: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = (3/2) \cdot 3^{n} - 1/2 = (3^{n+1}) / 2 - 1/2 \) <nEwLiNe>Simplify: <nEwLiNe>\( a_n = \frac{3^{n+1} - 1}{2} \) <nEwLiNe>So, for n = 9, <nEwLiNe>\( a_9 = \frac{3^{10} - 1}{2} \) <nEwLiNe>Compute \( 3^{10} \). 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243, 3^6 = 729, 3^7 = 2187, 3^8 = 6561, 3^9 = 19683, 3^10 = 59049. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, <nEwLiNe>\( a_9 = \frac{59049 - 1}{2} = \frac{59048}{2} = 29524 \) <nEwLiNe>Which matches our earlier computation. So, \( a_9 = 29524 \), and the entire expression is 3 * 29524 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^{10} again: <nEwLiNe>3^1 = 3 <nEwLiNe>3^2 = 9 <nEwLiNe>3^3 = 27 <nEwLiNe>3^4 = 81 <nEwLiNe>3^5 = 243 <nEwLiNe>3^6 = 729 <nEwLiNe>3^7 = 2187 <nEwLiNe>3^8 = 6561 <nEwLiNe>3^9 = 19683 <nEwLiNe>3^10 = 59049 <nEwLiNe>Yes, that's correct. So, 3^{10} is indeed 59,049. Therefore, \( a_9 = (59,049 - 1)/2 = 59,048 / 2 = 29,524 \). <nEwLiNe>So, multiplying by 3: 29,524 * 3 = 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>But just to be absolutely thorough, let me compute each term using the closed-form formula to make sure that all the intermediate terms are correct. <nEwLiNe>For n = 1: \( a_1 = (3^{2} - 1)/2 = (9 - 1)/2 = 8/2 = 4 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 2: \( a_2 = (3^{3} - 1)/2 = (27 - 1)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 3: \( a_3 = (3^{4} - 1)/2 = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2 = 40 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 4: \( a_4 = (3^{5} - 1)/2 = (243 - 1)/2 = 242/2 = 121 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 5: \( a_5 = (3^{6} - 1)/2 = (729 - 1)/2 = 728/2 = 364 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 6: \( a_6 = (3^{7} - 1)/2 = (2187 - 1)/2 = 2186/2 = 1093 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 7: \( a_7 = (3^{8} - 1)/2 = (6561 - 1)/2 = 6560/2 = 3280 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 8: \( a_8 = (3^{9} - 1)/2 = (19683 - 1)/2 = 19682/2 = 9841 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>For n = 9: \( a_9 = (3^{10} - 1)/2 = (59049 - 1)/2 = 59048/2 = 29524 \) ✔️ <nEwLiNe>All the intermediate terms check out. So, the computation is consistent. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the value of the original expression is 3 multiplied by 29,524, which is 88,572. <nEwLiNe>Just to recap, the process was: <nEwLiNe>1. Recognize the nested structure and define a recursive sequence. <nEwLiNe>2. Compute each term step-by-step to find the innermost value and work outward. <nEwLiNe>3. Identify the recurrence relation and solve it using the method for linear recurrences. <nEwLiNe>4. Verify the closed-form solution with the initial conditions. <nEwLiNe>5. Use the closed-form expression to compute the desired term. <nEwLiNe>6. Multiply by 3 to get the final result. <nEwLiNe>7. Cross-verify all steps and computations to ensure accuracy. <nEwLiNe>This systematic approach helps avoid mistakes and ensures that each step is logically consistent with the previous one. It's a bit time-consuming, but for a problem with multiple layers of recursion, it's the most reliable method. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, one might consider using iterative computation, plugging each result back into the next layer, which is essentially what I did in the first part. However, recognizing the recurrence relation allows for a more elegant and quicker solution once the closed-form is derived. <nEwLiNe>In conclusion, after carefully computing each step and verifying through multiple methods, the final value of the expression is 88,572. <nEwLiNe></think> <nEwLiNe>The given expression is a nested sequence that can be simplified step-by-step by recognizing a recurrence relation. Each layer is defined as \( a_n = 1 + 3a_{n-1} \) with \( a_1 = 4 \). Solving this recurrence relation leads to a closed-form formula, confirming each intermediate term. Finally, multiplying the ninth term by 3 yields the result. <nEwLiNe>**Answer:** \boxed{88572}"

 Let me try to parse this step by step. Maybe I can work from the innermost parentheses outward. That usually works for nested expressions. So, starting from the very inside: <nEwLiNe>The innermost part is (1 + 3). That seems straightforward. Let me compute that first. <nEwLiNe>1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Okay, so the innermost parentheses simplify to 4. Now, moving one layer out, the next expression is 3 times that result. So, the next layer is 3*(1 + 3). But wait, actually, hold on. The structure is 3*(1 + ...). So, the innermost parentheses are inside another set. Let me make sure I get the structure right. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the entire expression is 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(... and so on. So each time, it's 3*(1 + something). So starting from the innermost, which is (1 + 3), which is 4. Then moving outward, the next layer is 3*(1 + 4). Then the next layer is 3*(1 + result of the previous layer), and so on. <nEwLiNe>Let me write this down step by step. <nEwLiNe>Let me define each layer as L1, L2, L3, etc., starting from the innermost. <nEwLiNe>L1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>L2: 3*(1 + L1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>L3: 3*(1 + L2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>L4: 3*(1 + L3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>L5: 3*(1 + L4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>L6: 3*(1 + L5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>L7: 3*(1 + L6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>L8: 3*(1 + L7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>L9: 3*(1 + L8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Wait, but the original expression has nine layers of 3*(...). Let me count the number of opening parentheses. Starting from the beginning: <nEwLiNe>3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3)))))))))) <nEwLiNe>Counting the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3: each ""1+"" is followed by a 3(...). So, starting from the innermost, each layer adds another 3*(1 + ...). Let me count the number of 3s after each opening parenthesis. <nEwLiNe>Wait, perhaps it's better to count how many layers there are. Each time you have a 3 multiplied by a sum starting with 1, so each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). Let's see how many times this happens. <nEwLiNe>Looking at the expression: 3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3(1+3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>I can see that starting from the first 3, each subsequent 3 is nested deeper. Let me count the number of 3s after the initial one. <nEwLiNe>Starting from the first 3, then each subsequent 3 is inside another set of parentheses. So, how many 3s are there? Let me count: <nEwLiNe>1. The first 3 is outside everything. <nEwLiNe>2. Then inside, there's another 3. <nEwLiNe>3. Then another 3. <nEwLiNe>4. And so on. <nEwLiNe>Wait, actually, each layer adds a 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost, which is L1: (1 + 3). Then each layer adds another 3*(1 + previous layer). So, how many layers are there? Let me count the number of opening parentheses after the initial 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting after the initial 3, each 1 + 3(...) is a layer. Let's count the number of opening parentheses after the first 3: <nEwLiNe>After the first 3, there are 8 opening parentheses: each ""1+"" starts a new layer. So, that would mean 8 layers? Wait, no, because each layer is a 3*(1 + ...). Let me see: <nEwLiNe>Wait, the expression is: <nEwLiNe>3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3*(1 + 3))))))))) <nEwLiNe>So, starting from the innermost, which is the last (1 + 3). Then each layer is 3*(1 + ...). So, how many layers? Let me count the number of 3*(1 + ...): <nEwLiNe>From the innermost, each time we have a 3*(1 + ...). So, starting from the innermost: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, that's 9 layers in total. So, starting from layer 1 up to layer 9. Therefore, the final result is 36084. <nEwLiNe>But let me verify that. Maybe I should compute each layer step by step, just to make sure I didn't skip any or miscount. <nEwLiNe>Let me write them down: <nEwLiNe>Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. <nEwLiNe>Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, that seems correct. So, the final result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>But just to make sure, let me compute it step by step again, perhaps using a different approach or checking for a pattern. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, I can think of this as a recursive sequence. Let me define a function f(n) where f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Then, f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 15. <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 48. <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 147. <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 444. <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 1335. <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 4008. <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 12027. <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yes, same result. So, that seems consistent. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, is there a formula for such a recursive sequence? It seems like a geometric series, but let me see. <nEwLiNe>The recurrence relation is f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)), with f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>Let me expand the first few terms to see if I can find a pattern. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(2) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>f(3) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>f(4) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>f(5) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>f(6) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>f(7) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>f(8) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>f(9) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Looking at these numbers: 4, 15, 48, 147, 444, 1335, 4008, 12027, 36084. <nEwLiNe>I notice that each term is 3 times the previous term minus something. Wait, let me check: <nEwLiNe>15 = 3*5, but 5 = 1 + 4. <nEwLiNe>48 = 3*16, 16 = 1 + 15. <nEwLiNe>147 = 3*49, 49 = 1 + 48. <nEwLiNe>So, in general, f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)). <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, we can write this recurrence as f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = 3*(1 + f(n-1)) = 3 + 3*f(n-1). <nEwLiNe>Yes, so f(n) = 3*f(n-1) + 3. <nEwLiNe>This is a linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found. <nEwLiNe>The homogeneous solution is f(n) = A*3^n. <nEwLiNe>For the particular solution, since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can try a constant particular solution, say f_p. <nEwLiNe>Assume f_p = C. <nEwLiNe>Substitute into the recurrence: C = 3*C + 3. <nEwLiNe>Solving: C = 3C + 3 => -2C = 3 => C = -3/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the general solution is f(n) = A*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Now, apply the initial condition f(1) = 4. <nEwLiNe>f(1) = A*3^1 - 3/2 = 3A - 3/2 = 4. <nEwLiNe>So, 3A = 4 + 3/2 = 11/2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6. <nEwLiNe>Thus, the general formula is f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2. <nEwLiNe>Simplify this: <nEwLiNe>f(n) = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2 = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Wait, let's see: <nEwLiNe>(11/6)*3^n = (11/6)*3^n = (11*3^{n}) / 6 = (11*3^{n-1}) / 2. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, f(n) = (11*3^{n-1} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Let me check this formula with n=1: <nEwLiNe>f(1) = (11*3^{0} - 3)/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=2: <nEwLiNe>f(2) = (11*3^{1} - 3)/2 = (33 - 3)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=3: <nEwLiNe>f(3) = (11*3^{2} - 3)/2 = (99 - 3)/2 = 96/2 = 48. Correct. <nEwLiNe>n=4: <nEwLiNe>f(4) = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Wait, no, wait: 3^3 is 27, so 11*27=297, 297-3=294, 294/2=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, no, wait, 3^{n-1} when n=4 is 3^3=27, so 11*27=297, 297-3=294, 294/2=147. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, n=5: <nEwLiNe>f(5) = (11*81 - 3)/2 = (891 - 3)/2 = 888/2 = 444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Wait, hold on, 3^{n-1} when n=5 is 3^4=81. So, 11*81=891, 891-3=888, 888/2=444. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Similarly, n=6: <nEwLiNe>f(6) = (11*243 - 3)/2 = (2673 - 3)/2 = 2670/2 = 1335. Correct. <nEwLiNe>Yes, this formula seems to hold. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, for n=9, f(9) = (11*3^{8} - 3)/2. <nEwLiNe>Compute 3^8: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561. <nEwLiNe>So, 11*6561 = let's compute that. <nEwLiNe>11*6561: 10*6561=65610, plus 1*6561=6561, total is 65610 + 6561 = 72171. <nEwLiNe>Then, 72171 - 3 = 72168. <nEwLiNe>Divide by 2: 72168 / 2 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>So, f(9) = 36084. Which matches the step-by-step computation earlier. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the result is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Just to make sure, let me compute it using the step-by-step method again: <nEwLiNe>Starting with the innermost parentheses: <nEwLiNe>1. (1 + 3) = 4. <nEwLiNe>2. 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. <nEwLiNe>3. 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. <nEwLiNe>4. 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. <nEwLiNe>5. 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444. <nEwLiNe>6. 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335. <nEwLiNe>7. 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008. <nEwLiNe>8. 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027. <nEwLiNe>9. 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084. <nEwLiNe>Yep, same result. So, I'm confident that the answer is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>Alternatively, another way to think about it is that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, each step is multiplying by 3 and adding 3. So, it's similar to a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3, but each term also adds 3. <nEwLiNe>But we already have the formula, so that's solid. <nEwLiNe>Therefore, the value of the expression is 36,084. <nEwLiNe>**Final Answer** <nEwLiNe>\boxed{36084} <nEwLiNe>"
