Alright, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3)))))))))\). Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses! It looks like a recursive expression, where each layer is 3 times (1 plus something). Let me try to break it down step by step.
First, maybe I should start from the innermost parentheses and work my way out. That seems like a logical approach because each part of the expression depends on the result of the inner one. So, let's identify the innermost part.
Looking at the expression, the innermost parentheses is the last one: (1 + 3). Let me compute that first.
1 + 3 = 4.
Okay, so replacing that innermost part, the expression becomes: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))\).
Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should label each layer as I go. Let me number them from the innermost as Layer 1 to the outermost as Layer 9.
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Then Layer 2: 3(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Wait, hold on. Let me make sure. So each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So starting from the inside:
Layer 1: (1 + 3) = 4.
Layer 2: 3*(1 + Layer 1) = 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15.
Layer 3: 3*(1 + Layer 2) = 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48.
Layer 4: 3*(1 + Layer 3) = 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147.
Layer 5: 3*(1 + Layer 4) = 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444.
Layer 6: 3*(1 + Layer 5) = 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335.
Layer 7: 3*(1 + Layer 6) = 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008.
Layer 8: 3*(1 + Layer 7) = 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027.
Layer 9: 3*(1 + Layer 8) = 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084.


Wait, so the outermost layer is Layer 9, which would be the entire expression. So, is the answer 36084? Hmm, let me verify each step because that seems like a big number, and I want to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.
Starting from the inside:
Layer 1: 1 + 3 = 4. That's straightforward.
Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15. Correct.
Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48. Right.
Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147. Yep, 49*3 is 147.
Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148. Let's compute 148*3: 100*3=300, 40*3=120, 8*3=24; adding them together: 300+120=420, 420+24=444. Correct.
Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445. 400*3=1200, 40*3=120, 5*3=15. So, 1200+120=1320, 1320+15=1335. Correct.
Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336. Let's compute that. 1336*3: 1000*3=3000, 300*3=900, 30*3=90, 6*3=18. Adding them: 3000+900=3900, 3900+90=3990, 3990+18=4008. Correct.
Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009. Calculating 4009*3: 4000*3=12000, 9*3=27. So, 12000 + 27 = 12027. Correct.
Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028. Let me compute that. 12000*3=36000, 28*3=84. So, 36000 + 84 = 36084. Yes, that's correct.
So, after verifying each layer, it seems like the final result is 36084. But just to be absolutely sure, maybe I can compute it another way or see if there's a pattern.
Looking at the layers, each Layer n is 3*(1 + Layer n-1). So, it's a recursive sequence where each term is 3*(1 + previous term). Let's see if I can find a pattern or a formula for the nth term.
Let me denote a_n as the value of Layer n. So:
a_1 = 4
a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1})
This is a linear recurrence relation. Maybe I can solve it to find a general formula.
First, let's write the recurrence:
a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3
Wait, no. Wait, a_n = 3*(1 + a_{n-1}) = 3 + 3*a_{n-1}
So, the recurrence is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} + 3.
This is a nonhomogeneous linear recurrence relation. The general solution can be found by finding the homogeneous solution and a particular solution.
First, solve the homogeneous equation: a_n - 3*a_{n-1} = 0.
Characteristic equation: r - 3 = 0, so r = 3. Thus, the homogeneous solution is A*3^n.
Now, find a particular solution. Since the nonhomogeneous term is constant (3), we can assume a constant particular solution, say a_n = C.
Substitute into the recurrence:
C = 3*C + 3
C - 3C = 3
-2C = 3
C = -3/2
So, the general solution is a_n = A*3^n + (-3/2).
Now, apply the initial condition. When n=1, a_1=4.
So,
4 = A*3^1 + (-3/2)
4 = 3A - 3/2
Add 3/2 to both sides:
4 + 3/2 = 3A
Convert 4 to halves: 8/2 + 3/2 = 11/2 = 3A
So, A = (11/2)/3 = 11/6
Therefore, the general solution is:
a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2
Simplify:
a_n = (11/6)*3^n - (3/2)
We can factor out 3:
a_n = 3*(11/6)*3^{n-1} - 3/2
Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:
a_n = (11/6)*3^n - 3/2
But let's compute a_1 to check:
a_1 = (11/6)*3^1 - 3/2 = (11/6)*3 - 3/2 = (11/2) - 3/2 = (11 - 3)/2 = 8/2 = 4. Correct.
Similarly, a_2 = (11/6)*9 - 3/2 = (99/6) - 3/2 = (33/2) - (3/2) = 30/2 = 15. Correct, as we computed earlier.
So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, for Layer 9, n=9:
a_9 = (11/6)*3^9 - 3/2
Compute 3^9: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243, 3^6=729, 3^7=2187, 3^8=6561, 3^9=19683.
So, a_9 = (11/6)*19683 - 3/2
Compute (11/6)*19683:
First, 19683 divided by 6: 19683 /6 = 3280.5
Then multiply by 11: 3280.5 *11
Compute 3280.5 *10 = 32805
Compute 3280.5 *1 = 3280.5
Add them: 32805 + 3280.5 = 36085.5
Now, subtract 3/2: 36085.5 - 1.5 = 36084
So, a_9 = 36084, which matches our earlier computation. So, that's a good verification.
Alternatively, maybe I can see this as a geometric series or something else. Let me think.
Wait, another way is to notice that each layer is 3*(1 + previous layer). So, expanding each term:
Starting from the innermost:
Layer 1: 4
Layer 2: 3*(1 + 4) = 3*5 = 15
Layer 3: 3*(1 + 15) = 3*16 = 48
Layer 4: 3*(1 + 48) = 3*49 = 147
Layer 5: 3*(1 + 147) = 3*148 = 444
Layer 6: 3*(1 + 444) = 3*445 = 1335
Layer 7: 3*(1 + 1335) = 3*1336 = 4008
Layer 8: 3*(1 + 4008) = 3*4009 = 12027
Layer 9: 3*(1 + 12027) = 3*12028 = 36084
Yes, same result. So, all methods lead to 36084. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is 36084.
I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the multiple approaches (step-by-step computation, recurrence relation, and verifying with a formula) all give the same result. So, I think I'm good.
**Final Answer**
