Okay, so I have this expression to compute: 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3))))))))) 
Wow, that's a lot of nested parentheses. It seems like each layer is another set of 1 + 3 multiplied by something. Maybe I can simplify it step by step, starting from the innermost parentheses and working my way out. Let me write it down as I go.
Starting from the inside:
The innermost part is 1 + 3. That's easy, 1 + 3 is 4.
So replacing the innermost part, the expression becomes:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(4)))))))))
Now, let's compute the next layer. It's 1 + 3(4). So first, 3 times 4 is 12, then 1 + 12 is 13.
So replacing that, the expression is now:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(13)))))))
Next layer is 1 + 3(13). 3 times 13 is 39, so 1 + 39 is 40.
Updating the expression:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(40))))))
Next up: 1 + 3(40). 3*40=120, so 1+120=121.
Expression becomes:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(121)))))
Now, compute 1 + 3(121). 3*121=363, so 1+363=364.
So now, it's:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(364))))
Next, 1 + 3(364). 3*364=1092, so 1+1092=1093.
Expression now:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1 + 3(1093)))
Compute 1 + 3(1093). 3*1093=3279, so 1+3279=3280.
So now, it's:
3(1 + 3(1 + 3(3280))
Next, 1 + 3(3280). 3*3280=9840, so 1+9840=9841.
Expression becomes:
3(1 + 3(9841))
Compute 1 + 3(9841). 3*9841=29523, so 1+29523=29524.
So now, the expression is:
3(29524)
Finally, multiply 3 by 29524. Let me compute that:
29524 * 3. Let's break it down:
29000 * 3 = 87000
524 * 3 = 1572
Adding them together: 87000 + 1572 = 88572
So, putting it all together, each step simplifies the expression, starting from the innermost parentheses and moving outward. Each time, I compute the innermost expression, replace it, and then move outward until I reach the final result.
Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere.
Starting from the innermost:
1 + 3 = 4
Then, 1 + 3*4 = 1 + 12 = 13
Next, 1 + 3*13 = 1 + 39 = 40
Then, 1 + 3*40 = 1 + 120 = 121
Next, 1 + 3*121 = 1 + 363 = 364
Then, 1 + 3*364 = 1 + 1092 = 1093
Next, 1 + 3*1093 = 1 + 3279 = 3280
Then, 1 + 3*3280 = 1 + 9840 = 9841
Next, 1 + 3*9841 = 1 + 29523 = 29524
Finally, 3*29524 = 88572
Hmm, that seems consistent each time. So, I think my calculations are correct. Each step builds on the previous one, multiplying by 3 and adding 1 each time. It's interesting how the numbers grow exponentially as we move outward.
So, after carefully simplifying each layer step by step, the final result is 88,572.
**Final Answer**
The value of the expression is oxed{88572}.
